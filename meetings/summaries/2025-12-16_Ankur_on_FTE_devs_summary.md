# Ankur on FTE devs - Summary

**Date**: 2025-12-16 15:04

---

### Candidate Screening Process

- Ankur will forward FTE developer profiles directly to Jesse for review - Internal blocking limit of 5 days caused some candidate loss
  - Remaining candidates will be assessed tomorrow with HR team
- Interview structure: 1. Internal rounds (1-2) for communication and basic JD requirements
  2. Jesse’s screening round (30-45 minutes)
  3. Final discussion round with panelists
- Jesse prefers to conduct screening rounds to assess candidates personally

### Timeline & Holiday Coordination

- No hiring decisions until early January due to budget approval pending
- Jesse unavailable entire week of December 23-27
- Most team members also off following week
- Candidate interviews postponed until first week of January - HR will confirm candidate availability to wait until January
  - Some candidates were immediate joiners

### Backend Developer Requirements

- Core stack: Python, Django, MySQL
- AWS services experience crucial: - RDS, Lambda, SQS, CloudWatch
  - General AWS console familiarity preferred
  - Don’t need to start from scratch on AWS
- Working style expectations: - Light on formal processes (small shop environment)
  - Candidates should ask questions when specs unclear
  - Comfortable with back-and-forth on requirements

### Frontend Developer Adjustments

- Original JD requirements modified: - GraphQL not super important (mostly abstracted)
  - Mobile focus reduced to “nice-to-have”
  - PWA experience challenging to find but trainable
- Future mobile strategy clarified: - No native app planned
  - Would package web app in Capacitor/similar wrapper
  - Angular/TypeScript remains primary skill focus
- Global Logic can provide internal training for PWA/mobile skills

### Next Steps

- Ankur sends updated candidate profiles by tomorrow - Will copy Jason on communications
  - Fresh assessment of available candidates for both roles
- Weekly check-ins scheduled starting January - Will include project director Rashmi
  - Regular cadence for ongoing support and updates
- 10-hour time difference (Jesse EST, Ankur IST) creates favorable overlap vs PST clients
