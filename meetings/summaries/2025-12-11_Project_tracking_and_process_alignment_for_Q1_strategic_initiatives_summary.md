# Project tracking and process alignment for Q1 strategic initiatives - Summary

**Date**: 2025-12-11 20:59

---

### Project Management Process Dependencies

- Marketing team needs sales preparation materials aligned with new project requirements
- Clear BRD/TRD template ownership needed between Charity and current speaker - Intelligence report responsibilities unclear
  - Initial vs draft requirements ownership undefined
  - Approved BRD standards missing
- Template standardization critical for delivery execution

### Project Visibility & Tracking Systems

- No single view exists for all project stages across production phases 1-5
- Risk of dev team bottleneck if all projects hit stage 9 simultaneously
- Tracking solution discussions: - Data responsibility lands with Chris
  - PMO handles visualization mechanics via Domo
  - Testing Microsoft Lists integration with ADO and 7Pace
  - Phase 1 focus: volume, velocity, volatility metrics

### Q1 Implementation Framework

- Three core processes being established with Gantt chart perspective
- Alicia and team testing visualization approaches
- Goal alignment around PMP documentation and process capture
- Template development included in three core processes rollout

### Organizational Accountability & Execution

- Cross-divisional dependencies requiring immediate attention
- Q1 rocks limited to 5-7 per division (some teams exceeded with 8-9)
- Success depends on collective execution, not just individual division performance
- Outstanding IDS items moved to CX board for follow-up meetings

### Action Items

- Chris: Own project data responsibility and metrics
- PMO team: Handle data visualization mechanics
- Alicia: Continue testing visualization tools with current team member
- All teams: Focus on Q1 rock execution with cross-divisional support
