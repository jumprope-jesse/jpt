### Current SMS Setup & Costs

- Amazon Pinpoint at ~$0.007 per segment (0.7¢) - 5-10k outbound messages weekdays, ~1k inbound
  - Currently ~$3-4k/month SMS costs
  - Messages often 8-10 segments due to auto-translation compliance
  - 30 number pool for conversation mapping (10-DLC)
- Volume context: ~200k messages/month
- Post-acquisition: potential 20x growth but CFO now scrutinizing costs

### Sinch Capabilities & Pricing

- Direct carrier connections vs Amazon’s aggregator model - AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile (97% market coverage)
  - Could reduce costs ~50% at current volume
- Multi-channel platform: 1. SMS/10-DLC - competitive pricing vs current 0.7¢
  2. WhatsApp - affordable for transactional, popular with Spanish-speaking parents
  3. RCS - verified messaging with buttons, more expensive than SMS
  4. Voice - Intelliquent platform with translation capabilities
  5. Email - Mailgun (Sinch-owned) for full communication stack
- Conversation API: single integration for all channels
- Self-managed opt-in/out supported with AI assistance available
- K-12 messaging compliance experience, carrier fee waivers possible

### Next Steps

- Kevin to send RCS/WhatsApp/Conversation API info
- February follow-up scheduled - Jesse will know messaging product strategy post-acquisition
  - Parent Square relationship impact unclear (Aries uses Parent Square via Sinch)
- Implementation timing: May-June typical for school year transitions
