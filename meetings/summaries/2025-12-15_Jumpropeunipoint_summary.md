### SSO Migration Timeline

- Zendesk cutover delayed until January 9th (after holidays) - Most critical system due to customer-facing nature
  - Only 4 applications left: Zendesk, Clever, Zapier, Fellow
  - Username conflicts main risk (e.g., different email formats across systems)
- Clever, Zapier, Fellow migrations planned for this week - Light usage makes these easier to transition
  - Jenna coordinating with engineer

### Application Inventory & January Plans

- Applications to keep long-term: - Levio: Integrated into product codebase, staying ~1 year until help center migration
  - Calendly: Critical for sales/support phone scheduling
  - AWS: Eventually combining with Aries infrastructure
  - HubSpot: Future Salesforce consolidation planned
- Applications sunsetting January 9th: - Slack: Team anxious but switching to Teams
  - ChatGPT: Already canceled, using Copilot instead
  - Good background checks: Moving to ADP for payroll/benefits
- Minor applications requiring verification: - Earth Class Mail, Jotform, Never Bounce: Jenna to investigate usage
  - Wireguard VPN: Jesse’s personal backup system, keeping until Zscaler Q4 2026

### Password & Security Compliance

- MFA audit for all “keep” applications - Jeremy reaching out to application owners
  - Verifying unique passwords and recent changes
- Workstation encryption mostly complete - Most Macs encrypted, few exceptions need addressing
  - PC audit in progress
- Data storage centralized in Google Workspace shared drives - No critical data stored locally on workstations

### Google to SharePoint Migration

- Google Workspace consolidation completed - Critical files moved to governed shared drives
  - Half dozen shared drives with proper guardrails
- SharePoint migration timeline TBD - Need status check with Jenna on completion
  - Mass migration planned for first week back in January
  - Aries team will facilitate transfer

### Next Steps

- Teams training session scheduled for January - Q&A format for anxious team members
  - Webhook setup this week for notification channels

- Jeremy updating assigned tasks in planner
- Jesse can speak intelligently to Alicia and Jim about progress
