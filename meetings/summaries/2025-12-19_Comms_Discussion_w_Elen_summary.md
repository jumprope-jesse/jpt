### Product Background & Context

- JumpRope built messaging tool over 2+ years as Kinvolved replacement for NYC schools
- Tool integrates with attendance/behavior/gradebook functionality
- NYC pricing: $5/kid, relatively low profit margin
- Aries excited about messaging capabilities due to Parent Square contract expiring

### New PMO Process Challenges

- Accelerated timeline to build Aries communication replacement at ~$2/kid price point
- Significant rebuild required due to cost constraints - Current framework costs ~$1/student/year
  - SMS-heavy approach too expensive for target pricing
- Backfilling into new PMO process mid-development - BRD document creation (new for JumpRope team)
  - Usual agile approach: idea → Jesse builds → iterate with wireframes

### Document Structure & Requirements

- Ellen clarifying BRD vs PRD terminology - BRD = Business Requirements Document (Alicia’s template)
  - PRD = Product Requirements Document (comprehensive, includes market research, personas, go-to-market)
- Need separate product intelligence work for Aries customer evaluation - Who will buy integration product?
  - Pricing strategy for Aries customers
- Integration requirements need clear API touch points identification

### Parent Square Integration Analysis

- Ellen to provide comprehensive documentation: 1. Parent Square API information
  2. Fresh desk gap analysis (AI-generated, ~90% accurate)
  3. Aha access for PRD templates
  4. OE 2.0 PRD as reference example
- Current integration points include attendance notifications, templated emails
- Need demo of existing Parent Square configuration in Aries

### Market Research Constraints

- Challenge: Can’t easily interview Parent Square customers about replacement needs
- Alternative approach: Survey non-Parent Square customers first
- Need to identify which Aries customers use Parent Square vs other solutions
- Focus on lightweight messaging features vs full Parent Square rebuild
- Risk: Some SIS vendors (like Focus) include messaging in base pricing

### Timeline & Development Plan

- Q1: Build basic functionality in standalone tool
- Q2: Wire integration with Aries SIS
- Prototype approach: Live JumpRope app serves as starting point
- Need messaging demo environment with real phone/email testing capability

### Demo Access & Testing

- Ellen needs JumpRope admin and parent portal access
- Standard demo site available but messaging disabled
- Yumaris to create messaging demo with live testing capability
- Current parent engagement: 90% via SMS/email, minimal portal login in NYC market

### Next Steps

- Justin: Get BRD approved by ELT, initiate PMO process with Alicia
- Ellen: Send Parent Square documentation, gap analysis, Aha access, schedule integration demo
- Charity: Market research and go-to-market strategy development
- Team: Set up proper messaging demo environment for Ellen
- Focus on customers without Parent Square for initial research
