### Staff Augmentation Project Setup

- Budget approval still pending - expected by end of January
- Jason (Aeries VP Product & Engineering) confident about approval after board discussions
- Draft SOW sent to Jason with billing rates for both positions (frontend + backend)
- Global Logic providing all hardware, software licenses, and tool access (JIRA, BitBucket, AWS)

### Candidate Review Process

- All submitted resumes deemed decent matches
- Jesse reviewing with team member Jenna before final selection
- Current pipeline: 4 frontend candidates, 1 backend (Raju)
- Need additional backend candidate for comparison
- External candidates may not be available long-term - scheduling interviews sooner

### Developer Experience & Retention

- Global Logic retention: 80% of 2022 hires still active
- Minimum 18-month commitment, often extends 6 months to 8 years
- Some developers on same project for 11+ years
- Recommended experience level: 4-6 years for senior developers, then augment with junior staff

### Technical Alignment

- Jesse’s stack: Python/Django, MySQL, AWS services
- Database abstraction through Django ORM minimizes MySQL vs MS SQL concerns
- Raju (backend candidate) has matching experience including AWS
- AI tools mandatory at Global Logic - Code Buddy, QA Companion available
- Both Claude and Cursor widely used and supported

### Next Steps

1. Jesse to discuss candidates with Jenna today
2. Interview with Raju scheduled for tomorrow 10am EST
3. Frontend candidate interviews planned for next week
4. Jesse to provide availability slots via email by tomorrow
5. Ankur coordinating all interview scheduling
