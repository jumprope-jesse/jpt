---

### Personal Updates

- Weekend activities: hung Christmas lights, church, dinner at parents
- Got 3-4 inches of snow yesterday
- Attended two Christmas parties over weekend
- Bathing schedule for kids becoming irregular - relying on memory and smell tests

### Slack Migration & IT Updates

- Jeremy planning to shut down Slack early January
- Migrating SSO from Google to Microsoft
- Fellow potentially going away with Teams switch
- Considering new vendor for SMS with direct carrier rates to improve costs/deliverability

### Engineering Hiring Updates

- Two full-time engineer positions awaiting budget approval
- Andrea presenting full budget to board mid-to-late January
- Positions likely approved then, but wouldn’t start until April 1st
- Jesse considering asking for only one position instead of two
- Preference for someone at HQ who understands codebase vs remote developer

### Aries Integration Technical Discussion

- Met with Jenna, Caleb (developer), Wynn (developer), Jenny (BA), Sylvia (standards-based grading SME)
- Generated ~50 questions for technical requirements before writing specs
- Good engineer-to-engineer discussion, got about half answered
- SSO integration has one fewer development requirement - Aries has built-in navigation links to external resources

### Parent Square Analysis & Attendance Notifications

- Investigated Parent Square attendance notification system - Uses templates stored in Parent Square, not Aries
  - Supports text, voice, and email delivery
  - All reporting and delivery tracking handled by Parent Square
- Technical requirements for replacement: 1. Full data sync of identity and contact info
  2. Template editing capability
  3. Delivery method configuration
  4. Complete reporting system for who received what notifications
- Conclusion: Q1 attendance notifications replacement not feasible - Too complex for quick implementation
  - Would duplicate entire notification infrastructure
  - Many customers will continue using Parent Square anyway

### Product Development Status

- Angular/Angular Material upgrade 90% complete - Manual testing phase for visual inconsistencies
  - Cypress tests passing but need visual validation
- Business requirements document ready for ELT review - Work habit scoring marked as optional/not recommended
  - High development estimate for single-customer feature (Tahoe Truckee)

### Next Steps

- Jesse to finalize Angular upgrade with manual testing
- Justin to summarize Parent Square findings and propose continuing original plan
- ELT approval needed for JumpRope integration business requirements
- Holiday all-hands meeting tomorrow at 5pm Eastern (ugly sweater theme)
- Consider team member transition updates for all-hands presentation
