### Messenger Project Split Decision

- Discussed breaking messenger work into two phases after productive meeting with development team
- Jim fully supports the split approach - Asked about Alicia’s approval - confirmed she thought it was great idea
  - Everyone defers decision-making down the hierarchy
  - General attitude: “just get this fucking thing done”
- Next steps for messaging BRD: - Add developer estimates to document
  - Fill acceptance criteria with AI-generated content
  - Document ready for approval after sitting for a month

### Development Strategy & Timeline

- Build parent square replacement (Aries Messenger) first without integration complexity - Start February 1st, target demo by end of March
  - Full delivery by May 31st (originally June 30th)
  - Estimated 60-80 working days (3-4 months total)
- Integration work pushed to Q2 after core messenger built - Eliminates 3+ months of integration discovery calls
  - Allows parallel development approach
- Mobile app concerns: - Path unclear - embedded vs standalone app
  - Need early decisions for app store approvals
  - Will use Ionic wrapped in native app, not pure native
- Planning to use TalkJS for prototype/initial release - Faster development, proven chat UI
  - Timeline/chat interface most complex unknown
  - Enterprise pricing negotiation possible ($0.50 Amazon + $1.00 TalkJS per kid)
  - Can replace later in Q3/Q4 if needed

### Business & Contract Issues

- Tax return dispute with Joanne over $150K refund - Claims she can deduct 21% federal tax arbitrarily
  - Contract requires actual tax liability, not blanket percentage
  - $14K total at stake for both parties
  - Used AI to analyze stock purchase agreement from both buyer/seller perspectives
- Aries team technical complexity observations: - Business analysts running raw SQL queries
  - 20x wider application than JumpRope
  - Sylvia retiring creates knowledge risk
  - Product team hemorrhaging people
