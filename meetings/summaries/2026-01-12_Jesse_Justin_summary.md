**Date**: 2026-01-12 20:02
**Attendees**: Jesse Olsen, Jesse Olsen, Justin Meyer

---

### Personnel Update & Division Changes

- Randy terminated - directors understood the decision
- Jesse now most senior person in product division - Ellen pointed out seniority by tenure vs title
  - Jesse deflected to consider seniority by Aries time only
- Brent has call with product division after ACE Leadership meeting - Jesse not invited despite seniority

### Meeting Structures & Communication Gaps

- ACE Leadership = Aries Center of Excellence - Same people as QSO meetings with different name
  - Updates shared for director-level people
  - Jesse planning to attend today to listen only
- Multiple new meeting structures post-acquisition - Jesse doesn’t understand most of them
  - Poor onboarding on Aries processes and procedures
  - Feeling excluded from relevant communications

### AWS Account Migration & Budget Considerations

- Andrea pushing for AWS account consolidation into Aries account - Waiting on James to finalize new contract terms
  - Savings: $500-1K monthly (minimal impact)
  - Enterprise Support adds 15% to bill (currently basic support)
  - Migration work may eliminate perceived savings
- Jesse lacks full AWS access and prefers it that way - Avoids temptation to directly fix issues

### Staffing & AI Productivity Discussion

- Working with Nguyen instead of Caleb on SBG API
- Offshore hiring discussion: - EPAM rates higher than Andrea expected (~$100K vs her assumption of $50K)
  - Global Logic rates unknown to Jesse
  - Nathan hiring idea resurfaced - would cost ~$200K annually
- Jesse’s AI productivity proposal to Andrea: - Take one of two budgeted positions
  - Use half the other salary for AI budget
  - Track comparative productivity honestly
  - Andrea interested in the experiment

### JumpRope Communications Project

- Current goal: Get to step 8 (prototype)
- ELT approved breaking into two phases - Phase 1: Core messaging functionality
  - Phase 2: Integration work with attendance rules
  - Gives flexibility to scope integration work appropriately
- Jesse consulting on BRD with multiple variables to consider
