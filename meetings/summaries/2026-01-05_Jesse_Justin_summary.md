**Attendees**: Jesse Olsen, Jesse Olsen, Justin Meyer

### Angular Upgrade Progress

- Currently 85% through Angular 17 upgrade and material design legacy removal
- 40 failing tests remaining - mostly technical selector changes
- Decision: Push through completion this week despite potential high-stress release - Too much work invested to abandon
  - Will unlock modern development advantages
  - Third time executing similar upgrade

### JumpRope-Aries Integration Planning

- Business Requirements Document (BRD) 90% complete, awaiting final approval
- Technical Requirements Document (TRD) approach finalized: - Joint document between Jesse/Jenna and Aries team (Randy/Ellen)
  - 90% JumpRope work, 10% Aries work
  - Asynchronous collaboration instead of scheduling meetings
- Key technical decisions: - Class grade read-back: 2-day Aries estimate + 5-day JumpRope estimate
  - Auto-provisioning API/SAML credentials: No official Aries estimate yet
  - SSO implementation: IdP-initiated (no Aries code changes needed)

### Product Development Process Issues

- Current waterfall approach causing delays and inefficiencies
- Missing official templates and unclear responsibilities
- Executive team confusion about BRD vs TRD vs PRD roles
- Recommendation: Need early adopter/pilot phases for large products - Current products too big for assembly-line process
  - Need iterative feedback before full development

### Aries Company Dynamics

- Developer retention concerns: Kevin being let go, Caleb and others expressing dissatisfaction
- Bringing on EPAM remote resources while haggling over $150-200 AI tool budgets
- Jason cancelled Jesse’s 1-on-1s for 2+ months running
- ELT meetings showing disconnect between leadership optimism and execution reality

### Large Sales Opportunity

- Texas deal: ~700,000 students across multiple small districts
- 1.5-2 year implementation timeline if secured
- Technical complexity due to non-multi-tenant architecture
- Uncertain RFP scope and timeline details

### Messaging Product Strategy Concerns

- No clear customer validation process
- Building without direct customer feedback (unlike historical approach)
- Jennifer setting July sales targets before product completion
- Risk: Unknown market demand for planned features
- Attendance integration dependency still unresolved

### Action Items

- Jesse: Complete Angular upgrade this week
- Jesse: Continue TRD collaboration with Jenna asynchronously
- Justin: Connect with Brent about BRD splitting options
- Justin: Schedule meeting with Jennifer to address product concerns
- Justin: Clarify Aries dependencies for messaging integration with Ellen
