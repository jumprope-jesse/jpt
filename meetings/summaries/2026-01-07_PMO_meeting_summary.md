# PMO meeting - Summary

### PMO Project Status Updates

- Product integration BRD 99% complete - Missing only Aries development team estimates on 1-2 items
  - ELT approval scheduled for January 17th
  - TRD development 80% complete (Jenna leading format design)
  - Development work starting proactively to maintain May 1st deadline
- Project remains green with resource allocation from Aries sys team needed within 1-2 weeks
- Go-to-market knowledge exists across Jesse/Jenna/Justin but needs formal documentation

### Process Workflow Challenges

- Executive summary required for ELT review by end of week
- Justin responsible for ELT presentation and approval push
- New project tracking system in Microsoft Lists and Teams - Manual updates required every fortnight during progress meetings
  - Domo dashboard integration planned for approvals workflow
- Estimate delays highlight broader team capacity issues - Aries development team response time averaging 1+ weeks
  - Previous pattern: instant feedback now requires scheduled meetings

### Messaging Tool Strategic Pivot

- Current timeline assessment: underwater red for full ParentSquare replacement
- Proposal to split into two phases: 1. Standalone JumpRope messaging tool (immediate development)
  2. Aries integration BRD (separate approval process)
- Benefits of phased approach: - Smaller, manageable project chunks
  - Proof of concept for AresCon demonstration
  - Reduced implementation team pressure
- TalkJS suggested as rapid prototyping foundation

### Timeline Reality Check

- March prototype delivery possible with February 1st development start
- Production readiness by June/July requires optimal execution across all teams
- Current environment constraints make aggressive timeline unrealistic - Multiple major releases (enrollment, messaging, integrations) competing for resources
  - Recent rollback history undermining client confidence
  - Implementation team already behind on existing commitments

### Market Positioning Concerns

- Limited customer research capability due to ParentSquare contract restrictions
- Unknown feature prioritization without direct customer input
- Competitive landscape includes Focus offering similar functionality as SIS add-on
- Revenue expectations modest but replacement timeline driven by contract expiration

### Resource Allocation Issues

- Charity overloaded with BRD writing, marketing plans, competitive analysis, and go-to-market strategy
- Need for additional business analyst support under Charity’s management
- Director-level promotion push for Charity given scope of responsibilities
- Jenna’s reporting structure unclear across multiple potential managers

### Pilot Program Strategy

- Beta testing essential before full production release
- Tahoe Trucky identified as integration pilot customer
- Four-month pilot timeline more realistic than immediate production launch
- Sandbox environments available through select customers for testing

### Next Steps

- Justin: Send firm deadline message to Aries development team for estimates (due COB January 8th)
- Alicia: Add to estimate request thread, escalate if needed
- Jesse/Jenna: Continue TRD development and maintain project tracking updates
- Team: Schedule fortnightly progress meetings starting post-AresCon (March)
- Alicia: Present phased messaging approach to Jim and ELT for approval
