### Angular/Ionic Version Upgrade

- Major version upgrade in progress causing CSS styling issues
- Failed twice previously, now committed to completion this week
- Target release: Next Wednesday/Thursday
- Visual regression testing concerns - No visual tests on app, only Cypress functional tests
  - Need manual QA from business analysts or team members
  - Expecting 1-2 weeks of minor visual bug reports post-release
- Jenna designated as primary tester next week

### Standards-Based Grading Terminology Discussion

- Industry terminology constantly evolving: PBIS → SWBIS, RTI, MTSS, SBP
- JumpRope terminology debate - Current: “Standards-based grading”
  - Alternatives discussed: “Competency-based,” “Proficiency-based,” “Outcomes-based”
  - Market positioning opportunity with different naming
- Decision: Continue with current terminology for now

### JumpRope-Aries Integration Project Status

- Business Requirements Document (BRD) nearly complete
- Missing critical component: Time estimates from Aries CIS team - Requires 5-7 people in meetings to get estimates
  - Class grades write-back functionality scheduling confirmed but not sized
- ELT pressure mounting for completion - Justin missing Q4 goals, needs Friday deadline
- Technical Requirements Document (TRD) 80-90% complete - Format concerns about “Aries requires/JumpRope requires” columns
  - May need restructuring for ELT consumption

### Aries Messaging Project Planning

- Separate BRD in development
- TRD estimated 2 weeks after BRD completion
- Prototype delivery target: End of Q1
- Full product delivery: End of Q2
- Mobile-first design requirement for parent/student inbox interface
- Existing mockups available, may need interface updates

### AeriesCon Conference Logistics

- Monterey, California location with aquarium visit opportunity
- Presentation slots assigned: 1. Product demo (Justin and Becky)
  2. System building guidance (using existing playbook content)
- Attendance confusion: Hayley and Yamaris unexpectedly invited
- Open forum component for customer interaction
- Travel arrangements through Leslie

### Employee Onboarding Challenges

- ADP system completion issues affecting entire team
- Missing time-off request categories initially
- Document verification problems causing payroll delays
- Retirement contribution setup difficulties
- Responsible PTO policy questions - Under 4 hours may not require formal request
  - Policy documentation appears outdated

### Team Communication Strategy

- Weekly wrap-up meetings to continue during transition period
- One-on-one meeting coverage system proposed - Schedule meetings with Jesse for time-off flexibility
  - Team coordination for customer support responsibilities
- Microsoft Teams organization overwhelming - Multiple similar project channels causing confusion
  - Need to streamline channel participation

### Next Steps

- Jesse: Get Aries CIS team estimate by Friday for ELT review
- Justin: Present BRD/TRD status to Alicia this afternoon
- Jenna: Complete TRD review and formatting recommendations
- Team: Complete remaining ADP onboarding requirements
- All: Coordinate AeriesCon attendance decisions with Laura
