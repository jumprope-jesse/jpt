### Aries Acquisition Timeline & Process

- Started discussions in May, serious by end of June
- Signed LOI July 11th after 1 week turnaround
- Verbal offer within 3 business days of sharing financials/retention
- 60-day close (slight extension from 30-day exclusivity)
- Final close: early September

### Deal Structure & Financials

- 2.5x ARR multiple (negotiated up from 2.2x)
- 60% cash, 40% earnout over 18 months
- $1M company cash extracted before closing
- No equity component (cash-only deal) - Company financials: $1.8M ARR, ~$400K profit
  - Net retention: 104% despite 91-92% customer retention
  - Flat growth projection vs. reality due to unexpected losses (NYC schools)

### Key Negotiation Points

- Initial earnout tied to forecast growth - rejected by Jumpro
- Aries revised to employment-based earnout only
- Multiple competing offers with higher upfront but riskier earnouts
- Chose Aries for guaranteed cash and better cultural fit over PE buyers

### Aries & Francisco Partners Strategy

- First acquisition for Aries (second deal fell through)
- Francisco Partners backing acquisition strategy since majority stake purchase
- Target areas: standards-based grading, special education
- Andrea (new C-suite, 4-5 months) leading M&A - Background: accounting firms, Amazon aggregator (not edtech)
  - Francisco Partners’ person inside Aries team

### Team & Integration

- All 7 Jumpro employees retained (same salaries, converting to Aries benefits Jan 1)
- No contractual job guarantees
- Minimal disruption approach
- Cultural fit prioritized over maximum financial return
