### Aeries Integration Project Update

- Alicia approved business requirements
- Moving to technical requirements phase
- Assigned veteran developer (potentially Caleb) for Aeries API endpoints
- Coordinated roadmap with Aeries CIS team for February 17th release
- Class grade writeback scheduled

### Aeries Internal Chaos

- Multiple departures expected in Q1 (2-3 JD types including Tristan)
- Caleb removed from OE 2.0 for refusing AI adoption - Suggested reassigning him to JumpRope integrations project
- EPAM contractors quoted $150k for 6 months (2 people) - Poland developer: $100k
  - Belarusian developer: $53k
- Jason pushing for depersonalized development model

### Communications Product Progress

- Business requirements 90% complete
- Ready for stakeholder review (Alicia, Ellen, Charity)
- Scope decisions made: - Phase 1: Core messaging functionality
  - Phase 2: Advanced features (deferred)
  - Cut roughly 1/3 of original requirements
- Major technical components identified: 1. SIS integration
  2. Mobile app requirements
  3. Permissions system
  4. Content moderation
  5. Message translation (bidirectional)

### Product Strategy Concerns

- Focus competitor offering free communications
- Pricing uncertainty: $1-4 per student range discussed
- Risk: Building separate application vs. integrated solution
- No direct customer feedback mechanism available
- JumpRope as future Aeries gradebook requires long-term vision (2027-2028)

### Development Approach Decisions

- Build in JumpRope codebase/infrastructure (80% complexity solved)
- Jesse full capacity regardless of project choice
- No additional development resources needed initially
- Protect Jesse from process overhead during coding phase
- AI-first development approach leveraging existing advantage

### Mobile Strategy Requirements

- Need clarity on app store publication process
- Prefer publishing under Aeries brand
- Require mobile app for push notifications
- Integration with existing Aeries mobile strategy unclear

### Organizational Dynamics

- Andrea only executive showing meeting leadership
- Lack of top-down product direction across company
- Jennifer terminated Sonority contract (lead generation focus)
- Becky promoted to director level
- Jesse team maintaining autonomy within larger dysfunction

### Next Steps

- Justin: Complete business requirements grooming
- Justin: Create executive presentation with SWOT-style analysis
- Justin: Schedule stakeholder meetings (Alicia, Ellen, Charity)
- Jesse: Attempt one-on-one with Jason for project alignment
- Team: Use QSO to communicate project progress
- Justin: Address employment status transition (JumpRope vs Aeries)
