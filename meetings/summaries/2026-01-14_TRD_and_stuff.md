### School Volunteering Experience at Luca’s School

- Volunteered at Luca’s Spanish dual-language charter school (Argo) - 90-minute observation in classroom
  - Helped kids with worksheets during instruction time
- Teaching approach concerns - Heavy reliance on videos for instruction - Math taught primarily through videos (language barrier issue)
    - Daily routine: video → worksheet → video → worksheet
    - Videos are “ancient” and projected, not engaging
  - Minimal recess: 9 minutes once daily in parking lot (no playground) - Should be longer and more frequent for 6-year-olds
- PE program issues - Young, inexperienced teacher can’t control class
  - When kids misbehave, entire class sits out movement time
  - Defeats purpose of compensating for lack of recess
- Positive observations - Teacher not overly strict - kids could wander during worksheet time
  - Luca seated strategically next to quietest kids in class
  - No major behavioral issues during visit

### School Comparison & Decision Factors

- Neighborhood school (Sato) advantages - Top 20 school in state with more resources
  - Technology classes, music twice weekly, robotics
  - Engineering after-school programs (Luca’s interest)
  - 70% Indian population with Indian food on lunch menu twice weekly
  - Better support for kids “outside the box” - on-staff psychologists
  - School bus pickup at 7:05am, drop-off at 2:45pm
- Current school transport burden - 1-hour daily round trip for pickup/drop-off
  - Jennette drives mornings, alternating afternoon pickup
  - Work day effectively ends at 2:30pm twice weekly
  - Unsustainable with potential new management oversight

### Family Logistics & Constraints

- Current arrangement with Jennette for school transport - Risk if Jennette stops participating
- Mom’s involvement challenges - Too emotional about Luca’s school experience
  - Treats every imperfection as emergency
  - Would require $20k annual budget for preferred school
- Uniform requirement at current school - Daily battles with Jake about wearing uniform vs soccer clothes

### Technical Requirements Document (TRD) Work

- Document formatting issues resolved - Automatic markdown formatting created unreadable diffs
  - Used Claude to clean up and make changes visible
  - Squashed commits to create readable comparison
- Accuracy approach decided - Don’t need high accuracy since no one will likely read document thoroughly
  - Delete liberally rather than over-promise features
  - Focus on realistic deliverables vs detailed specifications
- Key deletions made 1. “Aries customers live within one day” promise
  2. Detailed health check specifications
  3. Photo privacy controls (unnecessary complexity)
  4. Over-specific import timing requirements
- Terms and marking periods decision - Doing nothing in Phase 1 (same as current approach)
  - Potential future enhancement: “Apply to all schools” feature for 30+ school districts

### Next Steps

- Jenna: Reduce TRD to ~10 key discussion points for final review
- Jenna: Send cleaned document to Alicia to confirm format acceptability
- Jesse: Review SAML sections and other technical areas Jenna flagged
- Consider spreadsheet format if document approach insufficient
