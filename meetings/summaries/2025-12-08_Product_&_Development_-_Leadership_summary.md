### QSO Preparation & EPAM Update

- No specific preparation required for QSO - just show up
- EPAM engagement approved: 2 engineers for 6 months, $154k total - Price negotiation ongoing with Andrea
  - $108/hour rate needs reduction
  - ELT review in progress

### LACO & MCOE Projects Approved

- Both projects greenlit with maintenance fee structure
- Matt taking point on customer meetings
- Pricing: $250/hour + 25% maintenance fees going forward - Historical baggage: never charged maintenance before
  - Will negotiate final terms with customers

### CoreLogix Contract Discussion

- Andrea reviewing termination clauses
- Meeting scheduled 2:30pm today to discuss terms
- Considering 2-year vs 3-year agreement - Trying to lock in current pricing before increases
  - More flexibility with shorter term

### Cloud Cost Savings Initiative (2026)

- Andrea leading cloud savings project for Q1
- Team: Andrea, James, Jesse
- Redis caching evaluation priority - AWS OpenSearch Service vs Redis cloud offering
  - Need usage data before pricing decisions
  - May require external resources if significant savings identified

### Domo Engineering Metrics

- AWS cost metrics causing data ingestion issues - Shifting column problem in CSV files
  - May need Redshift/Athena solution for consistent schema
- Jesse to get Domo access to explore integration options - Preference to wait until backend systems integrate
  - Don’t want to confuse or pollute existing data

### AI Agent Development Success

- Matt Hoffman’s agent correctly identified escalation issues - Matched Kim’s manual research on same problems
  - Processed 90+ open escalations with recommendations
  - Team excited about potential time savings

### Online Enrollment Resource Changes

- Caleb struggling with AI-driven development approach - Dislikes code reviews (essential skill for AI workflow)
  - Not embracing spec-driven development process
- Matt Hoffman proposed as lead developer - Already bought into AI paradigm
  - Can move faster on project timeline
- Michael Katapang backup option if Matt unavailable
- Commitment: Matt won’t be pulled for other projects during OE

### JumpRope API Integration Update

- Business requirements approved by Alicia
- Moving to technical requirements phase
- February 17th target date in AHA roadmap
- Need technical consultation on: - User permissions and SSO implementation
  - Integration architecture questions
- Caleb or Tristan identified as potential Aeries lead developers
- Possible opportunity for Caleb if moved from OE team

### Next Steps

- Randy: Set up Claude access for Jesse using Aeries email
- Chris: Complete Domo access setup for Jesse
- James: Add Jesse to CoreLogix meeting today (2:30pm)
- Chris: Finalize NYR process documentation by December 19th
- Jesse: Review 90-day deliverables due January 9th
- Randy: Discuss developer assignments with team for OE project
