### AI Implementation Philosophy

- AI as tool enhancement, not talent replacement - Eliminates grunt work like manual time tracking
  - Skilled engineers benefit most from AI tools
  - Accountability still required - AI can’t sign off on work
  - Creativity remains with human engineers
- Civitas case study experience - Initial distrust evolved into comfort through education
  - Now use AI to fix AI-generated code rather than manual fixes
  - CEO went from diving deep into code to quick build-and-move-on approach
  - Different type of creativity, not elimination of it
- End users care about results, not code origin - Matt Hoffman doesn’t ask about lines of code written
  - CalPads users want intuitive, accurate, cool-looking interface
  - Focus on quality output regardless of creation method

### Outsourcing Strategy & Business Decisions

- JD’s departure creates resource reallocation opportunity - Respect for his career decision and talents
  - Business must evaluate onshore vs offshore placement
  - “Two for one” cost efficiency when possible
- IP and domain expertise constraints - Texas-specific work cannot be outsourced
  - Rebecca’s single points of failure require onshore support
  - Trademarked/patent work stays close to home
- Decision criteria considerations - P&L responsibility requires thoughtful resource allocation
  - Not made lightly or quickly
  - Executive team discussions focus on personnel morale
  - Balance business needs with team support

### Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

- Domain expertise value vs documentation gaps - Knowledge in heads creates company risk
  - New hires (onshore or offshore) need proper documentation
  - Domain expertise highly valuable but must be captured
- Matt Hoffman’s EDFI documentation as gold standard - “Rock solid” structure praised by FP during acquisition
  - Well-organized, nearly MD file quality
  - Enables quick understanding without 16-hour training sessions
- Historical documentation problems - Confluence often reads like phone conversations
  - Makes onboarding difficult for anyone

### Current Operational Challenges

- Fire drill frequency impacts productivity - Tracy’s example: multiple calls requiring JD coordination
  - Two-person coverage reduces fire drill impact
  - Increased output at same cost through better staffing
- Time tracking meta-problem - Need time tracker for time tracking work
  - Recursive stack overflow joke highlights complexity
