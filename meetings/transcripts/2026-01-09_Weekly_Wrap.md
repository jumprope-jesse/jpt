## Transcript

**Other**: Hello.

**You**: Hello.

**Other**: Hello.

**You**: Friday.

**Other**: It's Friday. Do you guys see? The elt update email.

**You**: It's good news, I think. From our perspective.

**Other**: Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. I always wonder why people leave, you know what I mean?

**You**: She was fired. Yeah.

**Other**: She was fired.

**You**: She was let go, I guess you could say. There's a new person coming in Monday. Yeah, she was my least favorite vp.

**Other**: So you knew about it?

**You**: My least favorite vp.

**Other**: She was what? I would agree. I know. I think everyone. I didn't know Aries felt that way, though.

**You**: Yeah, I only got wind of it, like, Wednesday. And officially yesterday, because. I don't know. I was talking to Andrea. She didn't give me reasons. I didn't ask. Justin probably knows the whole story. I haven't talked to him about it yet. But now that it's announced, he can probably tell us some things.

**Other**: I never even met her.

**You**: The new person is not going to be a VP of sales. He's going to be a chief revenue officer. All right, Jenna, how was your week? Yeah. Start while you're on course, you got to go.

**Other**: That's good. I spent a lot of time reading through. AI generated tech requirements. Learning what it's good at and what it's not. Like 2,500 lines. I didn't actually read all of it. A lot of it. Yeah. I was about the only thing out of the ordinary I did. Had some meetings about some meetings. Some other meetings. About some meetings. Did some support. But nothing too crazy.

**You**: Volunteer at Luca's school on Monday.

**Other**: Can't think of anything? Asked. Wait. I'm volunteering in Luca school Monday morning. I will be around in the afternoon. Gonna find out. What goes on in his classroom because he hates it there. Which kid? Luca. I always expected him to hate school.

**You**: Yeah, me too.

**Other**: Or kid has a long way to go still. I know he's never gonna like it. It's too much structure and too much expectation of staying in between the lines, and that's not how his brain works.

**You**: But he can rise above it, make it a meta game. It's easy to get A's. And be at school for the fun and the friends. That's my hope.

**Other**: I've tried to find, like a game he can do now, but we haven't found anything that engages him enough to do it. Count the number of times whatever it is happens today and tell me later.

**You**: Your teacher says something wrong, don't tell her, just count them.

**Other**: For a while. He took a little notebook and he would write down everything that happened, and he was really excited about that. Like, write down whatever happened that he wanted to tell me about later or whatever. And he's really slow at writing, so it, like, occupied a lot of time.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: But he got bored with that after, like, three days. Problem is with him, like, no. Is going to be interesting for more than, like, a couple days. So, like, you have to constantly keep coming up with new things.

**You**: Meta meta game.

**Other**: It's exhausting. He's an investigator. Private investigator.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: There's a game for you. Maybe find out which student in the classroom has without asking directly. Who has more than three pets or something.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: Might be a little beyond him yet. Dang. Well, no, you know what I mean. And then he'll get in trouble for asking every kid in the class the same question in the middle of some kind of instruction.

**You**: Bothering me about.

**Other**: My mom said to find out who has three pets. Yeah, it has to be some other kid into silently. You might. And then he'll get someone else in trouble. He's not good at subtlety. Doesn't understand how to do things under the radar. He mostly is just in trouble all day. Do I need to find something you can do? That will keep him to himself. He's not sitting in the corner by himself anymore, though, which is good. Only because some other kid was more disruptive than him. And got moved to the loner desk. The teachers put him in the corner.

**You**: That's the thing.

**Other**: I don't think it's okay. But it means that by himself. Same thing. I'm sorry you haven't dealt with that. Yeah, my teacher. To himself. I know. An overactive. But, yeah, he got put by himself. Yeah. This is why I'm going to volunteer in the classroom. Because I want to know. To see for yourself. So I could decide whether I need to go complain or whether he's being overly dramatic. Well, I commend you for doing that. Not all parents do that. But you definitely should. I don't know what else to do. I don't know if I don't like the school or I don't like the teacher, and I need to figure that out. Yeah. There are teachers that can accommodate that. Yes. Right. Yeah, I know. She is not a teacher who accommodates a kid who is outside the box as far as I can tell. And I don't know, I probably need to go talk to the principal, but I want to see what's going on so I have something besides his word to go on because he's 16 year. Olds.

**You**: The other thing is, he's got.

**Other**: If the school doesn't care. They're pretty good truth tellers. Actually, not this one. This one is an expert, not true seller. To the point where he doesn't even know what's true.

**You**: Yeah, he kind of lives in an imaginary land.

**Other**: His head are so complex. Anyway, if your school is not receptive to what I have, then I don't like the school, but. That's hard. Jenn, I'm sorry. I was really hoping this school would just be great and I wouldn't have to think about this again for another five years. But every freaking year with this kid, it's like a dramatic December, January, February. Well, I figure out if he's in the right school and we need to do something different next year. He doesn't belong in school. I hear you, jenna.

**You**: Had that conversation about Nolan a couple times, maybe.

**Other**: Basically every December to January something totally different next year, because this isn't working. It's fine at the beginning of the year because everything new and exciting is wonderful to him. He's a kid who just loves new things. And then once the excitement wears off, it's like, this sucks being his real self, which is not something that fits inside the school rules. Just like. I don't know what to do with them. We found our saving grace this year was the cello. Staff that has scratched the itch enough for Nolan. And Nolan's more introverted in his. Be quiet. Or not, but so he can hide, I should say, yeah. He's just always in trouble. He's not a bad kid. He's hard to deal with. I get that. Trouble, but he's just a lot. And it's true that he doesn't leave people alone. And that he doesn't get in his own space and he doesn't respect people's bubble.

**You**: That is true.

**Other**: I get that. He needs to learn that stuff. But not be flagged as a bad or troublemaker. Yeah. Not his fault. He means to do the right thing. Most of the time. It's not always, but.

**You**: All right, Hayley, next in group therapy.

**Other**: Group therapy. I'm glad we took long enough because I just got off a peloton ride. At noon and my heart rate's almost down, so I was still heaven and puffing. What I would share this week that's different. I have been flexing my used teams chat to ask Aries people direct questions. Muscle. Or exercising that muscle.

**You**: Nice.

**Other**: Just kind of feeling my way. It's been good.

**You**: You've had some success getting answers.

**Other**: Figuring it out. I've had some success and I've had some cyclical. Mom, ask dad. Dad, ask Mom.

**You**: Yep. Yep. That happens a lot.

**Other**: Yep. Mom asked grandma. But Grandma retired.

**You**: One time I asked Grandpa and he sent me to mom. And then mom got in trouble because dad wasn't invited to the call mom with.

**Other**: Right. Yeah. Who'd you ask? Hayley? Do you mind me asking? Oh, yeah, sure. No, I'll tell you guys the scenario. So it was the DPA I needed to get signed for the Michigan School. That's been an email since early December. And I know that Justin asked, Becky's asked. I have asked. I went and asked Sonia. I said, can you help me? Who do I need to talk to about this? And she said, just a second, I'll figure it out. Who to ask. I was thinking she'd just tell me. Let me tell you who to ask about it. Yeah. And then so she said, ask Jen. Operations, Jim. So I did. I direct chatted him or whatever. And he got back to me and gave me an answer. I had two. He gave me a direct answer for one of them. Which was he signed and sent me an attachment. The DPA that I needed signed. Oh, my God. That's all it took. That's all it took. Within an hour. Well, now you know. I know, I know. Yeah, and then the other one. It's an Aries existing district that's doing a JumpRope trial. But the sale on the trial was ours, not Aries. And so they were like, does the Aries security paperwork cover what we're doing? A JumpRope? Like, District needed confirmation of that. And I'd gone to the CSM for this district. Who? Her name is Elena, and she and I were kind of working on it. She was talking to sales about it anyways. Jim asked me to talk to Sales about that. Which was what I'd already done. But in the interim, Elena figured it out, so it got sorted. Yeah, but, yeah, I really did got. I got the actual file sent to me. That's amazing. And you know what? I got the check from Kent yesterday. There you go. Full circle convoluted sale we've ever had.

**You**: And Wasn't it like, $500 or something? Is this the one? Okay, minimum. Yeah.

**Other**: Probably my now spent considering all those involved.

**You**: Yep.

**Other**: But if they come on. It's not super small, though.

**You**: All right. Because it's a pilot.

**Other**: No. Yeah, it's a trial. It could be bigger. Where are they? Michigan. Okay? But supposedly with their DPA signed according to. Their security guy, whatever. One of their C level guys at their district. He put us into the Michigan database, whatever they call it. So supposedly any other Michigan school can see that we are an approved vendor. Which is actually very helpful. Yeah. Not that we're going to be selling in Michigan ever again, but, you know. Right? What if we do? I feel like every once in a while we get a little school in Michigan. Well, I just made our sales. No focus.

**You**: Our new environment. That's not a target market. Exactly. If they come to us, though, then it can be sold, right? I just don't think anybody's going to be targeting Michigan.

**Other**: Not going to be random. Well, if the new chief revenue officer.

**You**: Some of the re does, the undoing of the marketing, then we might get inbound again.

**Other**: Undoes some of what Jennifer had done. Yeah, we might get.

**You**: There is an opportunity there. I would probably.

**Other**: Our brand back a little bit.

**You**: Sit back for a couple weeks and let that guy get his footing. But I don't know. You know more than me, probably.

**Other**: Oh, no, I technically work for Laura right now, so that's Justin to battle.

**You**: That's true.

**Other**: But yeah. And he called me earlier and said that he has questions and he's seeking answers.

**You**: Wait. Who called you?

**Other**: What ifs? Justin. Has questions about what's going on. About. Well, does this mean then that we can continue working with sonority for month to month for a few months? So that those kinds of things are. Jennifer was a very much anti thought leadership as a way of building brand awareness.

**You**: Reengage.

**Other**: And that's how most people find us. So she had said, no more thought leadership. And then she got fired. Yes. So we might be back in business on that. You never know. Excellent. Yeah. Well, Hayley, I'll go next if you're done. Oh, yeah. No. My job requires me to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing, so I've been trying to set up one on ones with directors. And I met with Leslie, and I met with Marge, and I got a lot of. I have no idea. Yeah. So I do office hours and sessions or whatever. And I was like, so, Leslie, is that something you're going to book me into? She goes, I have no idea. I was like, okay, we'll figure it out. So what's meeting with Marge? And I was like, so, Marge. I'm here to help. I'm here to help get your support team up to speed on particularly standards based things. And she's like, well, we have a standard space grading expert. And I was like, yeah. And I'm here to help them get up to speed on understanding standards based teaching, assessing and reporting. And so we were talking for a bit, and we came up with a plan where I'm going to spend some meetings with Patty. And find out. What her level of knowledge is and whatnot, and I think I got across to Marge. I don't know how your support currently works. And I'm certainly not a support person at JumpRope, but I've done a little of it at times. And I used to be a district administrator, cc'd on every tech ticket. From my staff, and I can tell you that a lot of what gets dumped in support is angst and questions about the school's approach to standards based teaching and not. The JumpRope technology or them not understanding the choices the school has made. And she was just that kind of took her back.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: Well, they aren't used to supporting teachers. Right. Her whole brain think about. And that is a third or fourth time to say to Leslie, like, we just got to keep pushing that message. She said to me, I've said these things in not so many words. I figure that. And I said, Hayley and I. Hayley and I can show you some tickets and what we mean. And it really depends on a person's level of understanding of standards based practices. And that's when she's like, well, Patty is our expert. She's set up standards based report cards for schools. I was like, in the back of my brain, I'm like, okay, this is going to be a long. If that's who they're going to rely on for tooling up. Support. So I've been pre planning to meet with Patty, too. Setting time up with Patty, but having conversations with her and stuff, too. I told Marge I thought you and I should do it together. Okay? I'm happy to do it in tandem, though, if you have one and I have one, and then we decide to do one together. See where it's coming from, but, yeah. And then her other comment to me was, she goes, I have no idea what the plan is for that initial level of support. If Hayley going to be doing implementation. And so she's like, They have no clue. She's like, so just walk me through. And I'm like, I can walk you through what I used to do. And what I currently do. On occasion. And you can take that for what it is. So I talked to her about going in in the morning, looking at the unassigned stuff, seeing if there were any fires or catastrophes. And then picking off low hanging fruit of simple things and then starting to dissect more complex things and ask questions so that when everyone else was on board, they could answer it. And part of that dissecting was figuring out if it was a tech issue. Or practice issue or a combination and how to unweave that a little bit. And her response was, well, I'm not sure you're going to be in. It's going to be in Zendesk. And I was like, I think it would be the same, even if that makes no difference, in a different logo. Yeah. So I think, yeah. But I think that's deeper. That particular comment. Than where we're doing it. It is. What is? They don't communicate in the way that we communicate through a ticketing system. And I don't know how they do any of that communication or if you were going to give us fresh desk accounts so that we could see. I'm not in yet. I had to get it, like, SSO approved and stuff. Okay. Their stuff looks like so that we can have a better understanding of how to tell them what to think about ours. Because there's something. Every time I talk to any of these people and you guys have talked to them more. Than I have. I feel like there is just a complete lack of understanding of each other, like we're speaking different languages. Yeah. No. Like implementation, onboarding support. They have such defined lines. And departments and people that they have a hard time understanding what we're saying. Yeah. If we had something concrete where we could see. We've looked at their tickets and we're like, okay, it looks like your tickets, the way you structure this and the conversations you're having are mostly about technical things, say, or whatever it is that we find out in our discovery process hours. Here's how ours are different. If we have a concrete thing that we can look at it, and it might. Be. They just need to get into ours. Go ahead. No, go ahead. You're probably going to say. I was going to say I was meant to have a conversation with Sonya today, but she is out sick. But part of what my ask was going to be today, Tur, was like, pair me up and I want to be a mentor with someone and they mentor. Me, and I want to spend two hours in their life. Right. Like Patty. I just want to shadow her and she can shadow me. Just to start aligning the vocabulary. Yes. Aligning the concepts and finding where it's vastly different and where we can find matches. I think that. I want to get away from the higher ups. And start to get down in the weeds with people who are actually doing things. And I don't know, Patty's name keeps coming up and she's willing. I've met her a couple times. Right. And has a good attitude about it and stuff. No. Yeah. I think they need to come see us and Zendesk and what we do, and we need to see them having theoretical conversations. We need to, like, start getting our hands dirty, and somebody needs to actually. I foresee working with you quite a bit in the next two months, Hayley. Yeah, I think we need to. And I just think that it's going to happen. And here's a fear I'm just going to put out there if they get this Texas RFP. There's a big. Rfp many millions of dollars. 800 school units.

**You**: It's going to dwarf them caring about.

**Other**: Coming on board over two years. Almost 400 in the first year. They're not standards based. So I'm not worried for us. But it's going to implode their all system as they know it now and they already so busy. So they're going to have to be hiring people and training people to onboard that many. Just why aren't we just a branch? Well, that's why we just hire somebody for ourselves. Because. And so I'm just saying that. Because anything we plan with them right now, Could. And I don't know if anyone directorship knows that there's an rfp. I do, because all I interact with as directors.

**You**: It's come down through. Product directors are aware, but we were told to keep it confidential.

**Other**: I wasn't told to keep it confidential. But I feel like anything we say to one another in here is kind of the vault.

**You**: Yes. This is a safe space within ourselves. Don't go and take what we say here for direct career advancement. And if we do, don't attribute it to one of us.

**Other**: I do worry that their need to scale up. If they get this in the next couple of months,

**You**: Yeah. It's going to dwarf their growth from JumpRope, and nobody's going to give a shit about what's going on. A jump group.

**Other**: Could leave us in the dust. They're going to forget about us, is what you're saying. Because. Yes. Which I think could be.

**You**: That might be just fine. And we'll just say all we need is a full time support hire. We know who to hire. Us. Do it.

**Other**: That's fine. Exactly.

**You**: Yeah. I'm going to start a support agency. It's going to be an AI but I'll do your support for Ace.

**Other**: And we'll hire ourselves and they find our own person.

**You**: Hire my AI bot. Anyway. I think you're right, Becky. But from what I'm hearing, I think we're in the 5050 range of that. Coming through. I don't know. Maybe it's more advanced than that now. I didn't get any signals that it was, like, super likely to close.

**Other**: I know Laura is presuming it's super likely.

**You**: Okay? Now she probably knows a lot more than me.

**Other**: So I don't know, but I know she's got everyone in CX working, like we could be starting this.

**You**: I think from my perspective, if there will be a moment, it's probably not today. Where we say, hey, listen, it sounds like you're going all in on the Texas growth. All we need. Is to let us hire a person. Or two people or whatever we decide. And we should start thinking about what that person should be doing.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: But it can be our ideal. They're trying to give me two engineers. I'm trying to talk them down to one. Because I don't want to manage two engineers. But they have budget. And I can. Anyway. I think that's an opportunity for us to keep doing it our way a little longer. Maybe. Because it's going to take Aries a long time to figure out how to do it their way and not piss our customers off.

**Other**: Yeah. So on the one plus side, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to hop off in a few minutes. I feel like I've been talking too much. But I want to say thank you, Stacey. Because Courtney was awesome. Good. I didn't know if you guys were able to connect. She was super low key about it and just got me the answer. And it was good. And I have personally found the HR folks to be pretty helpful too. So that's. And it has been unepoint has been amazing. At responding. So some things are working very well. Good to hear.

**You**: Stacey, want to go next?

**Other**: So this week I got a little bit more formally integrated into the finance team. I got into their team's channel, their files and all of that kind of stuff. And then went to the first weekly finance meeting on Tuesday and learned some of the processes and things that I'll be doing with them. And then I mostly spent my time closing December and the year. And they really value a quick close, so. Today's the 9th, like I was. Done on the seventh, which is just so early compared to what I used to do. But, yeah, feeling a little bit more integrated. Slowly thinking a lot on how to. Integrate. Accounting Seed and their software. Their accounting software and all of that. And I think that's going to be happening pretty quickly. So I think I kind of emailed you all but the reimbursements that I process for you guys. That's obviously finished now, since we'll be being paid by Aries and I think there's a stipend that we receive. Moving forward in terms of expense reports. I think I'll have to do expense reports for January because they'll probably still be some charges on the old cards. But the idea would be to get everything over to your Brex cards and then use that system moving forward. So yeah. Thick in the transition, and I don't exactly know where we're going with things, but I guess we will figure it out. Sweet. Yeah.

**You**: Yamaris.

**Other**: Hey, peeps. I've had a hell of an interesting week this week. So, as you guys know and read and heard, Jennifer got let go. And I now work for the sales, or they're trying to incorporate me into the sales team. As their Sam for Focus in New York City. That's my so this came as a complete surprise simply because we had our all hands meeting yesterday. And there was a lot of conversation about what's happening and some of the things to look forward to for the upcoming year. And then our SCO is next week. Our sales kickoff meeting is next week. Everybody's meeting in California. I, however, will not be attending. I will be attending virtually because the Tech Summit is the week after that. So back to back conferences for me coming up. And then there's this business of Aries. Con. Did you guys get the email from Leslie? Has she hit you up? On a chat, whatever. Okay? So I had a lot of questions around it. Right. Because I initially thought it was just a general email for everyone. All employees of Aries. And then all of a sudden, it's like my name was called out, so I paid extra attention. It turns out that I'm coming in as a salesperson. So whatever the sales team is doing at ariescon, that's what I will be doing. I will be a representative of JumpRope if Becky needs me was a message. So I was like, all right.

**You**: Aren't you running the M and M booth?

**Other**: Yeah, and I'm running the Eminem booth, which I think is mostly hazing. They're trying to haze me.

**You**: Yeah. I'm pretty sure they're getting you somewhere over there. I really hope it's hazing.

**Other**: Like eminem. Yeah. So Aries Con. Every session in Aries Con is about an hour long and there's a 15 minute break in between every session so that people have enough time to travel from one session to the next. Along the path of these sessions is snacks. So you could get ice cream and you can get Eminem's and you can get different snacks along the way. So they told me that I'm going to be working the M booth, which is what the have to do. And I feel like I'm going to be hazed, but jokes on them, but they're getting into. I think the green M is a sexy Eminem. Right? The one that wears the gill.

**You**: Just show up in the full M mascot costume.

**Other**: Are you wearing a costume? Full Eminem costume. I don't know if that's a Sorry, Stacey, but guess what?

**You**: Lipstick, the eyelashes.

**Other**: You guys know me well enough that I'm down for all levels of shenanigans, so sign me up. I will wear the costume. I can picture it. And I think you would be phenomenal at it. I think so, too. And I'm like, you have the costume in your closet right now on the right high for it, too.

**You**: You might be the best, Eminem. I think you do.

**Other**: And the right attitude, like a lot of New York attitude on that. So anywho. So that's the story. And I already signed a release form saying that they could use my picture, right? That was part of the thing that we signed for onboarding. So I don't know, I'm setting myself up for disaster this year, but there it is. So the message, the take home message is they want our flight plan so they can coordinate because there isn't a direct flight to Monterey. So everyone is flying into San Jose, California, and from San Jose to Monterey is. About an hour, an hour drive. So they're going to set up a van in my brain I think is a party van, but who knows? What you were expecting JumpRope to do, right? And then showed up with a truck. And he jumps down. He's like, get in. I was like, what the hell is going on? I was like, I can't even climb this monster truck. How am I supposed to get up there? He thought it was hilarious. And then he was like, yeah, we're going to go food shopping. I was like, dude, this is the first time I ever meet you. In person. I'm getting into your truck and driving to go pick up food. I feel like I'm losing it. What an experience. So apparently that's happening all over again. So we're getting the bus. You won't be alone at least? Yeah. Leslie said that most people are coming in anywhere from like 9:30 to like 11:30 in the morning, so that if I can try to get a flight around that time to. Get their Monday morning. Then this way I can make it onto the bus with the rest of the folks. But I think it was really funny that it was like, you're going in as sales, but if Becky needs you, Then you're doing that. And I was like, I don't think.

**You**: I predict Yamaris standing in the San Jose airport looking for the bus. And having missed it. At 2:30 being like, I guess I should call somebody. And you're having an outfit. That's right. With the coffin.

**Other**: For my Eminem outfit in my m. And the coffin. You imagine? Oh, my God. Full of Ms. Crazy. But apparently we're wearing, like, polos shirts. Yeah. Team shirts. I was like, what the heck? Where did that. It just came in.

**You**: Get. It. Get it good. Y.

**Other**: This came in. Yeah, hot off the press. Yeah. Do I have to use my nectar points? No, because those are taken. I have plans.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: They're socks. Low key. I got excited when Justin was like, oh, can we all get matching hoodies? I was like, are we? And I was like, oh, I'm a fool. I was like, everybody showed up with their JumpRope hoodies. We did our retreat, and I was like, the dope not wearing one.

**You**: I think we should. Aries. Aries. That should be our goal for you three.

**Other**: I was.

**You**: There's baseball caps. They've got coffee mugs, they got polo shirts just go full.

**Other**: Temporary tattoos on my face.

**You**: I bet you could make one with only minor copyright violations.

**Other**: Logo.

**You**: On the Internet.

**Other**: Y. Ep? Yep. I mean, I don't know. It's. It's going to be interesting. Apparently, there's a night event at the aquarium, so I'm really looking forward to that. I was like, I will go just for that, you know. My flight out, I think, is Thursday, though I haven't checked. Becky, have you figured out your flights yet, like, what you're doing? No, because leslie. Did some research. She's like, you can't get here without two layovers. I'm like, I know. That's normal. Yeah, I'm in the middle of nowhere, so she's letting me book my own stuff and because she was going to book it and I was like, good luck. And I haven't started looking at. But even if I leave here at 5am I'll probably be getting in around like 1 in the afternoon. There really isn't. I don't want to do a direct flight, if I'm going to be honest. I'd rather have a layover somewhere so that I could just take a breather and, like, eat something and then get on the flight again. Especially if I have to carry the coffin. But I guess the coffin is really your call. It's probably going to have to be Justin call. I don't think. They're expecting us to have an independent setup. I don't know. I'll find out. Okay. Yeah, that would be awesome. Because obviously, I have, like, the. The banners and the stuff here, and then this way I can make arrangements to, like, take it with me. Or if you only need, like, a handful of stuff, maybe I could just put it in my local, which will be a little bit easier for me. But, you know, I. I guess you let me know. I will. I mean. Before Jennifer's departure today, I would have said we wouldn't be using any of that because it's not co branded, because she was really big on Aries, on everything. But let me check. I'll ask around. I by the end of the month, I will know more if I need to go and do more printing of stuff like handouts. So, like, if you guys are planning to do handouts at the session and that kind of stuff, so let me know, because usually the tech summit, everybody just snatches everything from the table and we usually walk away just with the banners and the. And the tablecloth. So keep me posted. Yeah. I know exactly what we're doing. That will be. I will let you know. And is there an airline that you guys recommend more than any other? Like, it seems like Alaska, American, Delta and Southwest flies that way. Anything. I always fly American just because I have so many points and I want to, I get good upgrades. It's probably whatever you're more comfortable with. I don't think I've flown any other airlines above in the maybe, but I don't remember it. All right. Said. The best booze, too, actually. Cocktails from a local, like Portland cocktail. Place. I might have to booze it up today if I'm going to be honest, because this has been a hell of a week. Yamaris. Can I ask you, did anyone give you a heads up about Jennifer's departure before Brent? Yeah. So Matt pulled emergency meeting with everyone. Like maybe. 10 minutes before Brent's email came out. Go for the email and then came out almost at the same time. So we heard the message from Matt first, and then as we were in the call as a group, Luckily, he didn't. Matt is a very direct kind of guy. He doesn't like to, you know, sugarcoat anything. He just goes straight to the point. So he just laid the message out quick. Which. It felt better for me to hear it that way. Right? Like I don't like when people beat around the bush too much or give me a ton of small talk to deliver bad news. Just give me the news. You know, on a personal note, I'm really new to the team. I've only really for once. So it's not like I have long standing projects with her or I've known her personally in a way that it's going to impact me in a negative way professionally. Like, I'm saddened that that's the case because no one likes to go through any of that kind of process, you know, so it's. It's bad, but I feel like this whole year coming up, which is going to be a year of change anyway. Yeah, like. Aries, as a company, just wrapped up their year one. They're going into year two, and year two is usually when things start to get a little bit more settled. Roles get a little bit more defined, but there's still a lot of shaking going on, a lot of, like, shakeups. Going on. So I just expect year two to be bumpy for us. It's really for them in there, too, so, you know, I'm not. I'm sad for her. Like, human level, but I'm a professional level. I'm, like, more curious and interested in what's going to be the next step. Right. And I think so next week is going to give a lot of that detail. Of, like, how the company is seeing sales for the upcoming year, what are some of their goals, what are some of their objectives and, like, where they want to go with it. So I'm just going to keep my ears open. I will say. That in the all hands meeting yesterday when things were still on the up and up before the news dropped. The team was talking about some of, like, the things that are going well and some of the challenges for the future and, like, some of the opportunities. And some of my teammates said, oh, JumpRope also has a hybrid gradebook. They're not just standards based. And like, that warmed my heart. I felt so good that it came out of someone else's mouth and not me. Like, oh, they are listening. You know what happened? I had to do recorded demos. For the new New York sales guy. Wasn't the one who said it. It was like the other P. The California setting. Because I did this. Here's your videos. But please let me explain to you why these are different than California. Demos you have. And it was kind of like, oh. So I think they're starting to get that. And I think Matt thinks that's going to be a big sales feature in New York. I would have to agree with him. There's opportunities, and I'm happy that they're not seeing it through one lens, but they're being open and receptive to all the other messages that we're sharing with them. Right. Like the hybrid side and the messaging side and the standards based side, like. I'm going to really push more towards pe, like, professional development side, not just technical trainings, but, like actual professional development, because there's a ton of value in that. And right now, no one has said anything about it, it's been very quiet. At least from the sales side. So I'll push that on my side because there's a ton of value there. And, you know, the. The message should not be lost in the source. No, but I will warn you. And it's all going to change, I'm sure, with Jennifer's departure. But she was very clear with me that sales would not be selling professional services like pd. That she only wanted to sell software that had returning revenue. That message may change now. But that had been the directive. Prior. Yeah, well, I hope it does. I don't know who the new person is. So I guess we'll know who is coming on board next week. You know, they're supposed to be in attendance of the conference and the workshops and all that, so. We'll see. As soon as I know more, you guys will know more, but, you know, safe space here. Yeah, I don't. I don't know. It was quite the shakeup in. A lot of people seemed really, like, upset in the team. They were caught off guard. And there was a lot of questions around what that means for the rest of us in the team, like, do we get disbanded? Do they pull us into. Other spaces do we stay as a unit? How much support are we going to get moving forward? What's the line? The chain of commands? Now that things are different, you know, so who knows? Cbd. I got to jump off. Hi, becky. Bye, becky. Jesse, did you go already?

**You**: I guess not.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Let's see. Jenna and I and Justin dragged the business requirements document. For the JumpRope. Ares Product Integration. Closer to the finish line. This is a list of 30ish requirements above the technical level. Basically user stories that we're trying to build to do SSO and family account integration. Class grades right back. So that project. Is inching over finish line. As I've mentioned, working on the development, because I'm assuming that I know better than anybody else who's making these decisions, what needs to be built still. For this particular project. This is the last time. That's true. And because I refuse to let that first thrust of integrating products fall flat. Regardless of how hard they try. So that is moving forward and is green. And I interviewed two remote developers. This morning. Kind of interesting. Yeah.

**Other**: No, you did.

**You**: They move fast.

**Other**: That was quick.

**You**: I think I'm going to make. Sort of a devil's bargain with Jason and Andrea. Jenna. I'm leaning towards taking on a back end engineer. To do maintenance, security work, whatever the hell.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And devopsy things.

**Other**: Y.

**You**: And then saying, don't give me the front end, engineer.

**Other**: Eah.

**You**: Give me 25 grand in Claude credits. Instead. And see what we can tear up, and I think it's a good experiment.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: One might be more productive than I think, and one might be less, and I don't know which.

**Other**: And then you get to see both. Yeah.

**You**: And that saves them money because two developers, developers a lot more than 25,000 a year or whatever I decide I ask for. But I can burn through 100 bucks in AI a day. A night. I can make Cloud work overnight for me.

**Other**: Right.

**You**: I guess they also do that in India.

**Other**: Right.

**You**: Anyway. So that'll be interesting to see where that shakes out. The budget is still in flux, but I'm kind of fighting to hedge remote against AI for adding capacity. I think that's it. I'm pretty close to done with this angular upgrade. Check in on Monday with Jenna, and Jenna and I are writing the trd, which is the technical requirements document. That follows the brd. Going back and forth.

**Other**: If I had to do that document and make it be for another developer or for an AI, I think it would take me 50 hours.

**You**: Absolutely. It would have taken me 50 hours to. I basically wrote it all. With. AI. In a fairly advanced way. It's pretty good, right? Easier to edit than.

**Other**: Yeah, and it was a great outline. You know, but if it needed to be updated to be, like, exactly technically correct in every spec and actually clarify exactly what needed to happen with, you know, it would.

**You**: Sure.

**Other**: Take. Yeah. 50 plus hours, maybe more.

**You**: I think. You're right.

**Other**: To write it.

**You**: This time around. It doesn't, because we will still be supervising individual items.

**Other**: Such that. Right? Yeah. It was just interesting to think about that, though. Like, that's what we're going to have to do.

**You**: It might be.

**Other**: In the future. It's going to be excruciating. But.

**You**: More excruciating pre AI.

**Other**: It's interesting. Yeah.

**You**: I don't know. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, I think. This is going fine.

**Other**: Y. Eah, same.

**You**: All right. Well. Reminder. Yeah. There's Tech Summit's not next week. It's Friday after next. That day. Jenna and I are going to Mexico. About my time off has not been approved by my manager yet. Just saying.

**Other**: Was. My manager doesn't care if I'm working or not is surprising.

**You**: My manager doesn't know if I'm working or not. He probably cares at some level.

**Other**: Right. Neither is. Fine.

**You**: And I took my Christmas tree down. And I'm still finding balls and needles and glitter.

**Other**: We're having an undecorating party today. Christmas tree undecorated.

**You**: All right, y'all.

**Other**: Oh, hey, Jesse. I just wanted to plant the seed back again when you want to, like, chat about, like, AI Chat or support bot.

**You**: Yeah, I was thinking about that today. Too.

**Other**: Yeah, I would like to. I'm very. I mean, like, where did.

**You**: Should we schedule? Jenna, you and I like a kickoff meeting. Or something or.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah, we. I don't know where we left. We were in process of doing some research around that. He'll have to dig up that JIRA card, but. Yeah, I think we should prioritize that for sure. Hayley. Yeah.

**You**: If you want to do a meeting to kick off, we could. The other way would be.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Like, we each write our sort of. What's our vision for this? Because what I'd like to do, I have a vision, but I'm not sure it's right. And I just mean, like, how you would interact with it.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: I'm torn between it being through private comments versus a fancy chat on the side and things like that.

**Other**: I'd like to, like. I'm not. I would, like, like, 30 minutes to talk to you guys about it.

**You**: Okay? I can do it now if you want.

**Other**: That's like talking and asking. We added into this. Meeting on Tuesday.

**You**: Maybe a Tuesday is tough for me. I'm out at 1 on Tuesday.

**Other**: If Jesse's free at that time. Maybe. Yeah.

**You**: I can do right now if anybody else can. An hour.

**Other**: I cannot. Take it back up. But I got it. I got to get Jake in five minutes.

**You**: Okay? You want to try in half an hour? Does that work for you? Or. No.

**Other**: I can get back on here in, like, 10 minutes once I have Jake in the car and talk all the way home. He usually is not terribly disruptive, so that is an option.

**You**: What about you, Hayley? Are you available?

**Other**: Otherwise it's going to be two of the clock my time before I get home.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: But take me 10 minutes to get him and get him in the car.

**You**: Well, Hayley, how about you and I just spent a couple of minutes. We'll loop Jenna in later. Let's see if we're even close to the same page of what we're thinking.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: We can just stay here and chat for a few minutes. Anybody else who wants to.

**Other**: Y. Eah. I can step for the five minutes.

**You**: What's on your mind in relayed shit to this Hayley, do you have. Does your brain start designing how it works? Or are you just dying to hear what I have in mind or what?

**Other**: Now I think. What do I want to say? I'm trying to. Like, how do I want to say this? Designing how it works. And what? It does like and how I. How a human interacts with it. Like a person like me, like, is it? You know the. I don't. And I don't know, again, like, how much better and smarter it can be. Than, like, the keep that's in Zendesk right now. You know? I don't know. I want to know things about, like training it. What we need for that. I want. We should. Yeah. I get finished. Sorry. That's. Okay? And then just what are some of our options around, like, how. It is. What I want to say, what triggers it, what questions it answers? Like, do we send questions to it? Does it go through the inbox and pick up things it thinks? Does it? Does a response from it always have to be approved by a real human? Like. Like what? I imagine, kind of the worlds are oyster and we can kind of decide what we want to do on those things, but.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: That's. That's kind of where I'm starting with how can we set the tone of what it's saying? And I guess this is all kind of training pieces, so whereas the interface, is it right in Zendesk? All of that business. What? What? Exactly. So we wrote up a task. At one point, we with me for no, Jesse and I did for, like, some research for it. And at the time, The thought was not that it would be interacting directly with customers at all, but that it would make a human much faster and much more useful, especially trained human. So, like, it would assume that we had more people. They just didn't know much. And what we were doing was was having it comb Zendesk to find, say, you know, the 30 most common implementation type questions and how we respond to them, what questions we ask next. How does that conversation look? Clarification so that it could hopefully prompt. I think the idea was it would be able to help a human get to the point where a decision was made and they could send it to you, escalate to you for, like, final yes, okay, and have the conversation that needs the right conversation and ask the right questions and, and tell the person the right considerations, you know, as to their decision, and then not allow anyone to do anything besides you as far as actually change settings, you know, and the idea was to try to take some of those really time consuming back and forth things maybe. So that was one thing that we had thought that it might be able to do. But. And there's a research, there's a juror card somewhere to complete that, like, research, but I don't think it ever got done. So anyway, that. That was one thing that we thought. Might help. Probably Zendesk History is the most like comprehensive information. Okay? But, yeah, that was the only, like, step we. That I know of that we took in that direction. And that doesn't have anything to do with, like, how you interact with it or whatever. It's just, like, what. What might be able to take off your plate. And that was my thought about what would be something. That we've never had a way to take off your plate before. You know that's not your one. I mean, right? Like, tier one is respond for tier one or, like, give prompts. Yeah, I mean, it could. Yeah, that was just that that's something that's a little easier because it's like comb the help docs and point the person to the right help. Doc, you know, like, tier one is more like that, which is pretty simple. And I was thinking, like, what else can we have it do? And that was, we don't want it to not do that. Like. I think that's right. Right, right, right. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But. Yeah, I don't know what I think the other questions would be. Like what? What else? Is a kind of a category, a bigger, you know, an idea of what. What it would be good at if it can use information in Zendesk, because we have to give it a pretty specific direction. If we're like, go comb all these tickets and do something like, we need to know what we're asking. For. It's like finding customer that particular customer history, finding similar questions from other customers. Right. Yeah, analyzing. What responses were. And I think one of the things that we were hoping it would do as part of this first round of stuff is like, document, like, you know, make documents for, for that internal for, like, you know, someone asks to add a missing work code, what questions do we ask? What considerations do they need to know? You know, and put it in a document, because it can do that too. And then it, you know, either those documents are in our code base and the AI can reference them, or, you know, or both. We can also make documents for a human, but it would be quicker if probably they were mostly consumed by AI. Yeah. That was the idea is like it could start by just compiling things because that's something that's going to take hours of its time. It's not something we can do every ticket as it looks at the ticket, but if it makes these documents, then those are quick to scan when it's looking at a ticket. Yeah. Like it makes its own encyclopedia. Kind of. Yes. It will make its own encyclopedia. And it'll chug through our tickets for four hours, you know, and make an encyclopedia, basically. Exactly right. All right, I got to hop off, but I can be back on in 10. 10 minutes or so if you guys are still here.

**You**: So I think my biggest question, Hayley. The world is our oyster. There's a pretty big difference between what I would call an asynchronous agent. And a synchronous agent. And so synchronous means you're chatting with it, you're watching a response, like using ChatGPT interface. And you get to just have these sore, throwaway conversations with it. And typically copy paste a result if you want. Or just use the results. To make your own comments on the ticket. So I'm not thinking it makes sense for me to try and build a deeply integrated intel Zendesk situation. Because A. I think Zentas gonna get swapped for Freshdesk. So I don't wanna bespoke it like the Innocep or whatever. That one that we have is pretty bespoke into the Zendesk interface, you know what I mean? I don't wanna spend a lot of time on that. That'll be a time sink. Not delivering value, delivering polish will go away if we switch to fresh desk, right? So I think it's either. A floating chat that just has magical context and tools behind it. That you can have. A conversation with and maybe one of the results is oh great, please post that as a comment to the ticket, but you can also just copy paste it yourself.

**Other**: Yeah. So it's an agent chat.

**You**: Well, it's an agent in the sense that behind the scenes.

**Other**: Yeah, yeah.

**You**: Yes. Oh, yeah, yeah.

**Other**: No, I am chatting as an agent, I am chatting with it. That's what I mean, yes.

**You**: We are months away from ever considering exposing us to the user. However.

**Other**: Sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I was like. Don't. Are you proposing that? Because. No.

**You**: There will be a point where you're like, man, this has nailed this ticket category every time.

**Other**: I mean, are you proposing a customer chat? No.

**You**: Let's just start autoresponding with clear fucking cash or whatever. There might be a moment where we deputize it.

**Other**: Totally. Totally.

**You**: But it'd be bit by bit.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Only if it thinks it's 98% sure. We can learn how much to trust it over time.

**Other**: Sure.

**You**: Anyway.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: The other way to do it asynchronously is in many ways a lot easier for me to build. And. It would be when a ticket comes in. It's going to analyze it. And it's essentially new. Ticket gets run through a prompt and it decides from a number of options. Like how to deal with it, but the result would be a private comment posted. From the agent. On the ticket. And that would be there, typically, by the time you open the ticket, because it's going to start on it immediately when the ticket comes in. And so you open the ticket, the customer's request, and you have initial research, and we can make that be whatever you want it to be. It can be all the way up to including a suggested reply, and you can ignore it or start to learn how bad it is or say we need to tweak it. So that it speaks more like this. You know what I mean? So I'm leaning towards the asynchronous, at least to start, because I think. It is a lot easier to build that. From my perspective. The technical stuff is easier.

**Other**: Okay? So. Okay, so let me. I got hung up thinking about some options that you said. So when you let me split Asynchronous and Synchronous from this perspective, and Synchronous is like, where I am as a person. I am chatting with it. And I want it to give me response. Asynchronous. You're saying that's where it's working behind the scenes? And provides me with something when I meet the ticket.

**You**: Yes, but then. So the asynchronous as a second component here, which is you can.

**Other**: But then, is it synchronous if I want to respond to it in that moment?

**You**: Write, then you can write a new private comment. You say,

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: Whatever you want and it will then post back as another private call up.

**Other**: Great.

**You**: So there's a couple of pros and you just won't get to see it do its fancy real time stuff. That would be.

**Other**: Sure. Okay? Y. Eah.

**You**: Your interface is private comments and mentioning JB basically.

**Other**: And, like, atmens or whatever.

**You**: Yeah. I want you to be able to sign something to Jenna with a comment or JB doesn't weigh in. I think JB would only weigh in as the initial ticket researcher in that upon request, it would always be a private comment, never a public to, till it's not right.

**Other**: Vehicle is. And. Then upon request. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I want the like. He doesn't need to weigh in unless he's being asked further.

**You**: But I think the initial weigh in is kind of important because A I'm going to use every ticket as training regardless.

**Other**: Kind of where it doesn't need to, right?

**You**: To help figure out how a response. What was the initial question? What was the final public resolution of this? And having that analysis baked in, there's some cost to it.

**Other**: Yep.

**You**: 20 cents a ticket or something. Maybe, but I think that's worth it. And we can make that initial research pretty good. I'm thinking it could get so far. As I'm pretty sure there's a bug. Here's a bug draft. Just tell me to post it and I'll add it to Jira and you say jnd go ahead and post that to Jenna. Things like that. So it will be able to do things on request, such as create bugs.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: Et cetera. Yeah, I think I'm going to keep it from making public comments until we're past the alpha stage.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: Yeah, exactly. You can say, hey, suggest a reply.

**Other**: Forgive me your reply.

**You**: And then I have some interesting ideas that I don't think we should get into right now about how you can give it feedback that gets automatically incorporated. I'm thinking you'll be able to make it so you can say at JB your suggested reply is good. But honestly, it's way too long. Stick to the facts, especially for this person and other IT administrators and IT will sort of know who is an IT administrator, just like you sort of know over time. And that feedback would not only get you a new suggested reply on that ticket, It would sort of file that away. For future reference too. So in a sense, be able to train it through your chats.

**Other**: Okay? Cool. Yeah.

**You**: And that's not just tone or brevity, but. I'm thinking you would have a you'd say yeah, jb, you miscategorized this ticket. You either need to fix your categorization logic or make it a category. If it doesn't exist, there will be a few lightweight data. Think of a tiny database behind this, which is just.

**Other**: This is wrong or this is incorrect or this is missing the point.

**You**: Like ticket type and ticket categories. Is this a problem? It'll do some of that automatic classification. I don't think I would even bother to update the ticket. I'm going to let you do that because I want you to pay attention and see if it's right. You know what I mean?

**Other**: Sure.

**You**: But over time, it could potentially.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Automatically escalate, automatically classify, automatically prioritize these tickets. So I think what I'll do is I'll make the initial prompt. My job is to make the agent run on a new ticket. And respond to mentions on ticket comments Private ticket comments. That will trigger. And we will just have, like, a collaborative. Prompt for what should it do when a ticket comes in? And the models are so good now that this prompt can be five pages long. It can be like, okay, here's what's happening. This could be a teacher, it could be a student. It could be a spam message. It could be. We kind of start to define what are the categories, and that's what Jenna, I think, was talking about, is, let's see if we can. Predetermine some of these categories in order to design JB better, right? Anyway, the prompt can be extremely extensive. And what it will have access to, which is superpower. Is customer data from Salesforce. Other tickets. Tickets from similar category, tickets from the same user, tickets from the same school, and it can go and explore those on its own. That'll be part of the prompt is attempt to find similar tickets by either. Finding, searching on the category. If you've been organized identifying key words. Looking for similar or same customer, that kind of thing. And it can go and just say, hey, man, this looks pretty similar to these other three tickets.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: This was a year ago, and it wasn't the same customer. But, man, they're similar. There's a decent chance it'll find them. And then finding them. It can point you to them, but it can also use the resolution of those in suggested reply. Kind of thing. So we would collaborate on that prompt. I would do the work to add the tools and make sure it knows how to look through tickets and stuff. And I would make self guided feedback part of it. I think I basically am saying that where things get really interesting is when you can instruct the agent to update its own prompt. So you don't actually have to go edit the five page prompt. You just tell JB I need you to be a little less verbose when you're talking to administrators. It goes, reads its prompt says insert it right here.

**Other**: Interesting.

**You**: It's pretty incredible. So you have. A self improving loop. If you will.

**Other**: Okay? Yeah.

**You**: Yeah. And then a further phase, the thing that's now possible that it's going to take us a while to get to, because I think we have a lot to work with for a month or two on just what I described.

**Other**: That's fascinating. But cool.

**You**: But then you can start to let it do things. With the data from our app, such as. Research what their settings are. Is a tool. I want to give it research.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Which functions in the app that you use as a customer. Yeah.

**Other**: That's like, usage. Okay, like. Like points and.

**You**: And that becomes part of the context that it uses to suggest a reply. And I honestly think that. We could make a human level agent. By the end of this spring. I think.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Just like human agent. It's going to fail sometimes.

**Other**: Yeah, yeah.

**You**: But as you start to gain confidence in hey, just like with Yamaris, anything related to Hybrid, feel free to just answer. But when it comes to the standards based philosophy, maybe pass it through me. We might just have a relationship with JB like that in less than until we teach it. Then it can train on our blog. Yeah. Read hattie. Read hatty.

**Other**: And feel confident in it. Yeah. And it can train on where we think it's deficient. Yeah.

**You**: Yeah. And start to give it more skills, essentially. And that'll take time, like Gitwood with a human. But then what you have is a tireless, inexpensive 24 7. Clonable. Agent. Yeah, it's Hayley. It's gotten crazy in the last.

**Other**: Agentics or whatever.

**You**: Six months in software Dev. It is getting crazy what the nerds are up to.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: With these agents.

**Other**: Yep. What do I want to say? Yeah. Yeah.

**You**: And it's when they get access to tools and data that they can crawl on their own.

**Other**: It's not lost on me.

**You**: That. It gets really fascinating. You can't paste every ticket into the prompt. That was the old way of doing it.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: It takes too long, it gets lost on the haystack, blah, blah, blah. You can't paste all the tickets in all of history as context and then say, oh, here's this ticket. Try to answer it.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: That's like bootstrapping from scratch every time. But now there's ways to build skills and knowledge sets that it can sort of bring into its context on demand. Like I said, based on similarity of keywords and stuff. And really interesting stuff. Becomes possible.

**Other**: Yeah. It's like. It's brain science, it's wild.

**You**: Okay, well, I'm going to start to tiptoe into the async part. There's a way that later on we could make it fancier, but I kind of like to just interact through private comments as a starting place. It's simple.

**Other**: No, I think that's a great. That's. Yeah. I'm down with that. I don't need it. To be a. Yeah, like a chat window yet.

**You**: Okay? And the one thing that the thing I was worried about with you is are you going to be too hesitant to ask its stupid questions because you don't want the record of the private cons of the stupid questions. You asked it where you would ask it. The stupid question experiment more if I don't mean a stupid question. I mean, like, experiment.

**Other**: No. I think it would be.

**You**: Because if you have a chat window. That's a throwaway. But if you have it in private comments, those are sort of there forever.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it will. That will taper off.

**You**: Right.

**Other**: As I learn, right?

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: And. You know, I could see it being, like, a really long text thread.

**You**: Yeah. But honestly, that's kind of interesting training data. Because my plan will be I'll then feed when that resolves eventually.

**Other**: For a couple of tickets. Worse. But.

**You**: With a comment to the customer, an acknowledgment that it's fixed. Having not just a question and final answer, but the steps that went through. That's valuable training data for JD on the very next ticket.

**Other**: That's not. Yeah, that's an opportunity for training.

**You**: So pretty interesting. Yeah. I'll get something off. I'll get something off the ground. Maybe next week. One concern is sort of ironic.

**Other**: Yeah. I'm worried.

**You**: Is. I don't know what this is going to cost because. I'm not interested in working with the smaller, cheaper, worse AI models. And there's a very clear winner right now. But it's expensive. I haven't gamed out how much this is going to cost. So I'm going to smuggle it in our AWS budget for a while. But I don't know if I get away with that forever. And they squeeze and everything.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: So at some point, we're probably going to have to. Demonstrate this. In order to pay for it, get budget approval.

**Other**: Justify it. Justify its budget? Yeah.

**You**: And so I think that's part of the goal will be. And keep this in the back of your mind. Showcase tickets. At any given time, if Laura were to come and say, you got to show me this jump up thing. I keep hearing about it, and now it's in my budget.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: Just have an idea of what you would show them. You know what I mean? And if it's failing, you won't have anything to show and won't matter anyway because you won't really use it. Well, except for if I run it on every ticket, automatically that comes in forever.

**Other**: Well, it cost me thing if I'm not using it. Oh, that's true. It cost a little bit.

**You**: And I might have to turn off the every ticket at all times and make it upon request only or something. But we'll sort that out, I think for a month or two nobody will know this.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: I guess.

**Other**: Y. Eah. Cool. Okay.

**You**: All right, that gives me enough. I needed you to tell me you were okay with the asynchronous private comment version because that is my preferred approach. It'll be much faster to iterate on, always less time on the interface. And work more on the technology.

**Other**: Y. Eah. Straightforward is fine. Yeah. Y.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: Eah.

**You**: I'm going to head out.

**Other**: Okay, cool. All right.

**You**: Have a good weekend. Yeah.

**Other**: All right.

**You**: I'm from.

**Other**: Thanks for sticking around. Okay? Bye.
