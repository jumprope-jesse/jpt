## Transcript

**Other**: While we're keeping AI adoption. Yes. Okay. Now, my question is, why is it going well, and it's also in the challenging, or are these different? Yeah. The board's going to have the same questions we need. Pick one. And I want to keep myself in check because I tend to be overly optimistic. The challenge has been for some folks to get on board and make it part of their day to day. And that was really with the online enrollment project. But we turned a corner on that. It's been really more open. And accepting as far as those processes. So I feel like it's less of a challenge and more of a going well. So maybe can we move it into an opportunity because. Yes, there we go. The adoption is accelerating, but there's always more adoption. Absolutely. Because we're getting formal with spec driven process, that'll help as well. And then I put here EPAM Resources. So we're thinking that those would help us, right? So can we. How do we want to present that? Goes in opportunities for sure. AI adoption specifically because that all ties together. Can I say? Epam resources increasing AI adoption. Yes across all teams. Yes, it'll start with online enrollment, but that's going to proliferate through the rest of the team. Okay, containerization. Is this still staying? I would. Remove that. It does. Texas regulatory head of schedule. I'm going to, because we have another reporting deadline coming up this week and we have a release going out today. So hopefully everything will be fine. But I don't want to jinx it or save the grade and then something happens. Okay. Automated testing on time budget. Can we remove? Aren't we done? I have it as a concern because our plan was to have end to end and then we've deprioritized that project. Remember that whole jquery regression suite? And we said it's oe for now. So that's a concern because that slows us down for. Need manual testers. But we'll get to that when we get to that box. So these are the only two things going well. Jesse, anything for you that we need to mention. Going well, box.

**You**: I would say the product integration is going well. It's going to be.

**Other**: For specifically SBG or both communicators. There's nothing for communications.

**You**: Sbga product integration. It's going well. Be done in time for sales season. That's. Oh, that's listed on opportunities. Look at that.

**Other**: Well, we can move it, right? Because it was an opportunity.

**You**: Yeah, let's put it going. Well. It was an opportunity last quarter, and now it's going well.

**Other**: I like that. Okay? So remove this. Well, is there still an opportunity for the communications project?

**You**: I would say let's just change that to Aries messenger, which is what I'm being told it will be called. And that. Is now our opportunity to move into that markup.

**Other**: Ed caching to lower Jess. James, I don't know what you want to do with this one. I feel like it needs to be in the challenges also, though. It's an opportunity. And the reason it's an opportunity is because Andrea is willing to probably open up the pocketbook to get it done. Okay? That's why it's in that box, that quadrant. And she'll probably speak to that. Perfect. Okay. AI Development on new and existing products. What's already happening on new. So can we just say an opportunity is for existing, Randy? Yeah.

**You**: That's a good way to put it in both. With a distinction.

**Other**: I can say. AI adoption, accelerating development for new products. And then this can be for existing. So it's clear that, yes, we knew we were good. Existing, there's room for growth. Okay, so I wanted to put something down. For online enrollment. We're developing it. We're not really thinking from the inside's perspective. Like, we're not implementing matomo. We're not thinking of other tools. And I feel like there's. We roll it out because we want to know who's using it, who's adopting it. Which features. So what do you think? And Jesse, I don't know. Insights platform that you're using for JumpRope, like window or. There are quite a few out there.

**You**: You're talking about customer usage data.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: We use user pilot for that, which. Is, but we don't do much with it. We weren't organized enough describing and specking our events to make it useful and never had time to revisit.

**Other**: Okay? I'd like to keep it here and get Brent's perspective, if you guys are all okay with it. That's fine. Google Analytics is another way to consider too. We need to make a decision on that. It's part of the opportunity. Okay? So then we have the epam resources.

**You**: Across.

**Other**: Old team's concerns. Regulatory pressures, remediation, I think still the accessibility project we discussed still a concern. Texas regulatory still, especially districts from Region 20 RFP that's going to be. I don't know why it keeps jumping. I'm so sorry, okay? Tech debt Lego. Do we want to also security? Project. Yeah. I think it's worth mentioning showing that we're being proactive about it. Part of the tech debt, too, is our antiquated tooling with what we discovered, with reports, action reports. Do we want to say antiquated or maybe outdated? Okay. And we can remove some of these once we go over these with the Brent and he has his talking points. Testing, deprioritize you to resources, shifting to product development, and I'll say, oh, wait, 2.0. And then the other concern I have has with API.

**You**: Six.

**Other**: Someone removed it from this roadmap, and I wasn't sure if it was Brent or. Well, that was me. Okay? I don't think so. But he needs to know. He needs to be imported to them, so. I'm just going to say unrealistic timeline. And then I'll work with Brent on the wording for that. Okay. Anything else from Jesse? And for concerns or opportunities or challenges.

**You**: And again, to be clear, Justin will take a pass and fill in some probably some messenger related stuff that's in his desk and he'll be at the meeting.

**Other**: Okay? O. Kay and then for challenges we have regulatory landscape changes that stays enrollment tightly coupled with cis. Randy does this thing. Change. So if we reported it, it's still a challenge, right? Exactly. We haven't done anything to change that yet. Okay, resource constraints. I have. Sylvia is retiring and I don't have a replacement yet. And then aggressive roadmap pressures. I'm going to remove this because we feel that was the specific pressure, because I think everything. We had a reasonable plan at hand. So I think removing that from challenges and leaving it and concern more specific, because my initial thought when I saw that was, like, man, we send. We're complaining. I know we're up for the challenge. I was wondering about accessibility. That is refresh for me today after our meeting. Does that need to fit in anywhere in any of these boxes? Yeah, it's right here. Because Ada is that title. Great. Perfect. Okay, so key initiatives. I don't know. Who updated this? I did. I took the image of our fourth initiatives that we. Well, it was five. With API v6 and I put the other things in here. Just to give us a starting point. Okay, now, that's great. So this one's good. Increase unit test. Increase end to end test coverage. Is this happening, Randy? Because I don't know if I'm doing. That right now, but I'm getting planned together so I've got distribute and it can be done in piecemeal. There's a backlog that I was going to set up and then folks could just take from that incrementally if there have met their sprinkle. Do we want to say it's a risk, or you're confident that the playwriting is. I think it's going to be expanded beyond the playwright team. It is at risk because of the staffing. So at a minimum, we're still trying to get Global Logic to give us those 2s debts through March. There's a statement of work that's out there that includes them. JumpRope resources and cloud delivery resources and a lead sdet. And if I can get that approved, Then we're in better shape. Are you okay with being yellow or. Yellow? Yeah. Okay, so next one's increase unit test coverage. Yep. And this may be an all hands. I've got a plan drafted here for what specific pieces we're going to attack and what phases we can do this in. So I'm going to huddle with Nat and win. So I'm okay with this being green right now. Okay? And then so new enhanced product. I know in our goal we said for product enhancements. So that was supposed to include API, and now that we don't have, we're not going to have API. What is that fourth one? Because we've got Ollie, svg. Comms, JumpRope. And what? I don't know. I think the fourth one is going to remain API. Unless I'm just going to make this yellow and we can talk to Brent about it. Is that a good plan? I think that's best. Regulatory updates. So then we have our innovation roadmap. And brand can add back the API if you want to. So let's just kind of go through it because I want to make sure we think we are on track. So build, design, product and process continued, confirm requirements and market opportunity. I think this is fine. Sbgv5 API based data imports with daily updates. We're in California. I think that's fine. We're even ahead of the schedule because we're doing this. And then cons replace PSQ backend. How are you doing on this one, Jess? Or I guess Justin would have to update.

**You**: Yeah. From my perspective, that's yellow or red.

**Other**: On this call.

**You**: Nobody told me what's going on.

**Other**: Okay? Okay. From my perspective, it's fine because last time we talked to you said there's nothing and is needed from areas in Q1. So I'm like, okay, good.

**You**: That is true. Honestly, those cells are in the wrong order. But that's what was in the last board meeting. So it's up to Justin to decide how to communicate.

**Other**: It might be less of a technical issue and more of a business relationship and strategy issue, to be honest, because.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: Just because we unplugged doesn't mean that it stops working. That doesn't mean.

**You**: Right. Right. Justin will pour over that row he's agonizing over. Having committed to it, so he'll figure it out.

**Other**: Okay? So AI adoption. I don't have any new tools in my arsenal yet for Q1, except we're looking into PO seeing a video editing tool. So do any of these boxes need to be updated? For development, testing and cloud. Yes. Right now. I'll remove this, Randy, because you said you were going to try and make this work, so I'll keep. Yes. Okay, so clean up or add if. Go ahead, james. Sorry. I am on my phone. Never mind. I'll just add to my boxes on this one. Okay? And then as far as what do we want? Showcase specific. Driven development. Brandon and I are kind of both looking at open spec, and, Randy, this is like a. Side conversation I kind of want to have with you. Generally speaking, but open spec is easier. And. Students are pretty amazing stuff, and he's developing. The OpenID connect like front end really rapidly using it. But it has some implications on what we how we handle the specs moving forward and if we want to things in our repos, et cetera. But that's a showcase kind of item is how. It's definitely enabling us. Open spec. Ifically. So is it a full stack? Development enablement. Y. Es or is it infrastructure in DevOps acceleration? This is like in the legacy code base. Really rapidly allowing. I mean, it's allowing Brandon to move very fast. In the legacy code base, which is very promising. I even did a test run yesterday. Yesterday? Where I asked it to go through our code and add postgres SQL support for the backend. And it did a nine phase implementation and built it out in about an hour. Why they're not at work is another matter, but just to see what it would do. Legacy. Development. Legacy development and modernization too, I think, because I'm using a similar approach. For tackling some of the tech debt. When it comes to modernization. Okay? And I don't know if this slide is supposed to, like, building up. Or if we're supposed to only report on the new. So what I was going to do is, once we were done with this, I was going to try and invite Brent so we can review it with him and then just call him. I'm just looking at this slide. Title seems to be focused on welcome path. No, it doesn't need to be. It was last time we reported. But let's just take that out. Yeah, Perfect. It's whatever we have that we can showcase. So what can we showcase? I would talk. So I would remove anything that we told him last time because there's nothing more boring than to see the same thing twice. So then the only thing that's left is. That would be notable new things. It'd be like anything that Matt has done. Mcp. I would talk about perhaps the escalation. Yeah, the MCP for escalations. Think of the breakdown we got from Brent regarding what the guys at Civitas did? Those kinds of cool details. Cool. Enablements, the things that we did. And to enable efficiency gains, et cetera. So, like the escalation, MCP is great. The spec driven development. You guys did a pretty innovative thought, which was to integrate Claude with ADO and grab the specs from an ADO work item. And then taking that concept just one step further and taking those specs and integrating it into source code would kind of be like the closing the loop on that SDLC there. Is approach that I think is cool because it means you can get VAS in there without having to give them GitHub licenses. That's really cool. Yes. It's almost like ba is a dev. Okay. So help me the word smith. That. Okay, thank you. Sonde, just jump in there and update, and then I'm going to see if I can get Brunt. Here. He's probably in a meeting to review. That's okay, Jesse. Thank you.

**You**: Yeah. Sorry, guys. I'm on my way out. Mention me on teams, and I can fire off quick answers from my phone if you need me. Hey, Siri, turn on the office light. On. It. Okay? Siri, turn off the office light. For. One moment. Something. 's taking a little. Hit. Turn on the office lights. Office light 100%. Turn. Off the office. Light. S.
