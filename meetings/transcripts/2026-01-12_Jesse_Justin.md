## Transcript

**Other**: What's up?

**You**: Well. Randy was pretty quiet. In our meeting.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: He seemed like it was pretty close with Jason, but it was unclear if that was just. Because they were both desperately trying to get OE 2.0 on stuck or if they were friends or what.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah. It's so interesting when you have, you know, like, a bigger organization like this. It's like. It's not just a person you're getting rid of, right? It's like. Yeah, we were fortunate enough. In our organization. It's small enough that, like, every time we fired someone, everyone's like, thank God. You know?

**You**: You could reading between the lines. I think all the directors. Understood the decision.

**Other**: Yeah. I can't imagine it was much of a surprise to anybody.

**You**: Ellen, being the rule follower, made the point. She's like, you know, Jesse, you're actually the most senior person in the division now. I was like, well, I immediately said, let's consider seniority. By time and Aries and not by title for now. But it is true.

**Other**: This was. Was anybody else on the call, or was it just like the directors?

**You**: It was just the four of us, Randy and.

**Other**: Oh, man. Do you have a call with with Brent this afternoon?

**You**: Who, me?

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: No, not that I know of.

**Other**: How. Interesting.

**You**: They do.

**Other**: I thought. Okay? Because I know that Brent had a call. Brent said he had a call with. Product division after the ACE leadership meeting this afternoon.

**You**: Yeah, he didn't invite me.

**Other**: It's just so funny. I feel like because we got acquired,

**You**: I don't even know what the fuck Ace leadership is.

**Other**: I don't either. That there's so many things like that.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: That's like. Like that that showed up on my calendar last few months, and I just didn't go.

**You**: I haven't done that yet. It's during dinner time.

**Other**: Because I'm like, nobody. Nobody's told me what it is. Nobody's talked about it. It's just like, I'm not. And I was busy.

**You**: Yeah. Nobody missed me, as far as I know.

**Other**: I think that Ace Leadership is Aries center of Excellence. And it's just another. It's a bullshit name for the. The same people who go to the qso.

**You**: Right. Yeah, but they told me. I asked them. I've heard Aries center for Excellence and I know there's other non leadership ones. There's one word. I don't know. Operational excellence or whatever. Anyway. He did say that a lot of updates are shared for director level people at those, so I'm going to try and go today. I'm just listening.

**Other**: Make sure you put it in your comp time.

**You**: Right.

**Other**: So it's an hour late tomorrow. Yeah. You don't have your one on one with Jason tomorrow morning. Just show up whenever you want.

**You**: True. I just show up whenever I want anyway because nothing happens until noon.

**Other**: Well, I guess that's in the. I guess that's in the.

**You**: It's amazing.

**Other**: Exactly.

**You**: Yeah. Basically, if I didn't actually proactively work do things people haven't told me to do yet, I could just start working noon and stop at 5 and nobody will care. What else did I learn there? Andrea's been trying to get us to move our AWS account into their account. And to get the discount, but they're in the middle of renegotiating. Some larger long term spend commitment to get a new discount rate. So James is kind of putting it off. So if Andrea gives you crap, I am just waiting on James to know what his new contract is and decide if it's worth it. And they're going to save is 500 to $1,000 a month.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: No matter what happens, off our bill. Which is barely measurable in the scheme of things, right? Just to make that point.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: So I'm not going to push on any harder. Andrea's impatient because it's dollars that we don't need to be spending, and she's probably right. But I will tell you, we're going to have to use the enterprise Support, which is ads, 15% to the bill, which we don't pay for Right now we pay for only the basic support. And so it's basically going to chip away at what the perceived savings is.

**Other**: Well, actually spending more money.

**You**: And if it makes work for James and I, that's going to undo the savings immediately.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: If you actually think about time as money. Anyway.

**Other**: Then. Then you'd have access to their back end. Or maybe you wouldn't have access to ours.

**You**: Probably not, because AWS has massively complex security stuff and I doubt I would get full access, and I didn't really want it.

**Other**: Yeah. That's true.

**You**: I think if I had it, I'd be tempted to actually do something. I don't want to be.

**Other**: Like, let me fix this for you.

**You**: And it sounds like I'm going to be working with nguyen and not caleb on the sbg API stuff. Although it might not be all that much interaction, begin with. Giving Caleb another chance. Oe 2.0.

**Other**: Yeah, I talked to Jenna last week in our check in. And she brought up the idea of rather than hiring Offshore to take over and help hiring Nathan.

**You**: We did discuss that last week. It's not the worst idea.

**Other**: She mentioned that to you? It's not like it's really funny. Gosh.

**You**: I would love it. I would love it.

**Other**: Wouldn't it be funny?

**You**: Because he can work in this environment, probably.

**Other**: Yeah. His kids are so much older, and I'm sure he's got better habits. And, like, you wouldn't have to manage him.

**You**: He's not going through the ringer anymore. Right.

**Other**: Or at least maybe not. But, like.

**You**: However, he would cost 200 grand a year versus whatever the ex offshore people are.

**Other**: It's a fascinating idea. Yeah, but they're not. I mean. It's not that big of a discount on these offshore folks, like, you know.

**You**: So Andrea seemed to think it was like $50,000 a year per. And I'm not sure.

**Other**: No. One of them was like 100 at least.

**You**: She's got it wrong in her head. I wasn't confident enough to correct her.

**Other**: Well, I think she was like, She was balking at the numbers that Jason was showing. And Jason did get him down a little bit, but, like,

**You**: Is that epam or global object?

**Other**: They were still pretty high.

**You**: Do you remember? Okay, so my guy is coming from Global Logic.

**Other**: Epam.

**You**: I have no idea why.

**Other**: Oh, no, wait. Which one's the new one?

**You**: Epm is the new one.

**Other**: Okay. Yeah, yeah. These were epam numbers that we were looking at.

**You**: I know that's what's in negotiation. I don't know what the global logic rates are. Nobody's given me any insight into that. But I think Andrea might be confused about that, too, about how much it's going to cost.

**Other**: Yeah. But, like, to me, if you. Want to have institutional knowledge. Wouldn't you rather have a real employee?

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: Have that knowledge.

**You**: Exactly. But I don't know if they're real employees. Stick around that much longer, we'll find out, I guess.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: You can't count on a real employee being there forever either, but, yeah, who knows?

**Other**: But.

**You**: I propose to Andrea. I discussed it with her. We talked for about an hour on Friday. I think she called me to talk about aws, but I think she was really calling to tell me about Jen before the news broke. And I ended up. I had just gotten off. I interviewed a back end guy Thursday morning or whatever before I talked to her.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: I need to be fine. I'm not excited about it because, I don't know, I feel good until I try it. He's definitely got.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: The right sort of experience. It's kind of amazing they can just find somebody. That knows aws. Django, Python.

**Other**: And they have.

**You**: Tens of thousands.

**Other**: 100,000, 60,000 something insane.

**You**: It's nuts. Global logic is like. I can't remember if it's Hyundai or. It's so funny. These huge companies that make everything from, I don't know, jet engines to robots to memory chips. To cars. They have these just global workforces of engineers. That they outsource, and I think they use them internally, too. That seems to be what there's like, three or four big companies that do that. Anyway.

**Other**: Oh, interesting.

**You**: Part of Hyndai Group. I don't know if it. Honda is right. It's like one of those Japanese or Korean brands.

**Other**: Sl. Yeah.

**You**: Anywho, I did propose to her. Because the budget proposal that I haven't actually seen nor do I know what the dollar amounts are, has two people for me.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And I just like Andrea. I'm not sure if this will make me faster in the short run or the long run. It might do both or neither or one or only in the long run, right? But I do know that AI is making me faster now, and it's a lot cheaper. And I kind of gave her a five minute. Help her understand the renaissance that software is undergoing right now. Software engineering. And she's like, I love what you're saying. I also know that sometimes when I just have somebody working for me, it's just so nice because you can just tell them to do stuff. I'm like, yeah. And she's like, you just write down the steps. You figure out how the steps are, and you never have to do those steps again. I'm like, yeah, but, Andrea, when you're a software engineer and you can write, well, there's that. But if there's something that's durable and you can write down the steps and then do it 100,000 times. We fucking automate it. Because that's what we do. We automate shit. No software engineer is going to click the same 10 things more than 100 times before they just write a script, you know what I mean?

**Other**: Every day is a new set of steps. I know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**You**: And she's like, that's interesting. I've never had that option. I was like, exactly.

**Other**: Yeah, that's why. Yeah, exactly. That's where Joanne and I are, like, butting heads and, you know, trying to, like, integrate JumpRope.

**You**: She just wants to keep doing the process by hand. And you want to write Salesforce code to do it for you.

**Other**: Yeah. Exactly.

**You**: I think that's actually one of the biggest distinctions of people who understand software or not is they can automate their own jobs to some extent.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Anywho, I propose her. I was like, well, how about. Because she's like, we really don't want you to be working alone in that engineering. Okay, so how about I take one of the two? And then I take half of the salary the other, and I just get an AI budget. And I will track I'll only use what I need I won't just try and use it up and I will track. In some way that you can make sense of it.

**Other**: Who's. Who's more productive.

**You**: The productivity of both. And I don't have a dog in this fight. I just want to be more productive. If this guy's great, that's great. I'll be honest about it.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah.

**You**: I'm not going to engineer the results for you because the goal is productivity. And she's like, I really like the idea of that.

**Other**: That's fascinating.

**You**: So I might write something up for her around that. The other thing is. I'm using the AI now, and I've used more of it. I don't know when this person's going to actually start working for me.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: So I had that conversation with Andrea that was pretty interesting. And then, yeah, Ellen's bugging me about the JumpRope, communications and meeting our rocks. I was like, well, I'm consulting on the brd. There's a lot of variables.

**Other**: What is your guys rock for the communications. I feel like I don't even know what that is.

**You**: I don't. Fucking know. I think it's just JumpRope. Communications, get to step. Eight.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: Which is prototype.

**Other**: Yeah. I got the ELT team to approve breaking that apart into two pieces.

**You**: I think that's what she's talking about. Yeah, you mentioned that.

**Other**: So that's.

**You**: Though. I guess the way. I like that idea because a it means we didn't work on our own product first. Kind of like in a way that might benefit our existing customers and can actually have some usage. Like, I'd love to get admin messaging.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: In the wild in new york. Would be pretty cool, like scheduled messages and stuff.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: But I guess what's funny is. Wiring it up to their attendance notification rules. To me is just like it's just going to be mapping it onto whatever ours is because we have to write our own anyway. We have to write our own thing to configure a tenant's notification rules. Even if there's no interface for it. I need that stored somewhere.

**Other**: Y. Eah. Well, I mean. That, but even that might just not be a thing we do. Like.

**You**: Well, so I guess that's my question is, what is phase two? What is the second part, then, if it's not that?

**Other**: You know? It's just the scoping of the integration work. So it's whatever needs to be done. And so I think there's. It just gives us time to, like, mold that into what we think it should be. Before having to get all this other approved. So I don't. I don't actually know what it is, what it's going to be.

**You**: Because if it's. If that's what phase two is, it's just the attendance rules, that's going to be a very quick phase because we'll have already done the hard work. In Phase One, and that's fine, but it also gives us a place to just defer stuff that didn't make it into Phase One.

**Other**: Yes. Exactly. Exactly.

**You**: Yeah, that makes sense. All right, well, what else is going on? I got paid.

**Other**: Yeah. Me too. Not very much.

**You**: Like $7,900 or something stupid.

**Other**: I know. It's like. Like, oh, I'm poor.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: It's annoying on the bi weekly thing because your pay is like, like delayed quite a bit. Whereas, like, we got paid. Sometimes in advance of. You know, like at the 15th was a Saturday. Like you got paid on the 14th.

**You**: I haven't lived paycheck to paycheck for a while.

**Other**: I think. I'll be all right.

**You**: Plus we have, like, 1,500 Nectar points.

**Other**: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's like $120 right there. Don't spend it all in one place.

**You**: A. Yeah. Get some airy swag. I think maybe we should. Whoever goes to Ern, we should, like, outdo Aries. Like. Where all the swag.

**Other**: Roll up in Aries sweatsuit.

**You**: Everything. Sunglasses, tracksuit. Off, mu. G. Phone case. Phone charger. Bluetooth speaker.

**Other**: I'm not spending my nectar points on Aries swag.

**You**: One of the Spender points. On.

**Other**: Nothing.

**You**: I mean, Amazon gift card is the right answer.

**Other**: I don't know. To Amazon gift card. Yeah, exactly. Chipotle gift card. I don't know.

**You**: I've discovered that my 125th Street Chipotle. When you order from the app for pickup. They just wait until you show up and ask for it to make it. And it takes longer than if you just go and stand in line.

**Other**: That's funny.

**You**: But the delivery, the person who's delivering it shows up and asks for it. And then they make it, and then he brings it to you, and it takes a little longer because they didn't pre make it. But you don't have to stand there and wait.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: So I get mine delivered from four blocks away. Even though I'd rather take a walk.

**Other**: What you do is you just walk there and then meet the delivery guy at Chipotle. So all they're doing is really going into initiate it and then.

**You**: Hannah fiverr. Exactly. I just paid you the $5 to just save me 10 minutes. Worth of. Alex is 18 months today.

**Other**: Holy smokes. That's crazy.

**You**: It is. Time flies. We got an ultrasound tomorrow. See what's going on with this new one.

**Other**: All right.

**You**: AJ has been a mess, man. This is like twice as bad as our first pregnancy for morning sickness type stuff.

**Other**: That sucks.

**You**: Yeah, Seems like just sort of luck of the draw. I don't know. Not a lot of science behind it.

**Other**: It? Yeah.

**You**: There's, like, luck.

**Other**: There's definitely a lot of just. Like, whatever. Maybe that means it's a girl.

**You**: Right? And then everybody has their theories.

**Other**: Oh, yeah. I like Joanne's response to my. Negotiation.

**You**: Yeah, I've kind of lost the thread here.

**Other**: All right.

**You**: But sounds like they're just. She didn't want to admit she was wrong, but she's gonna give you what you wanted.

**Other**: It's basic. She's basically like, exactly.

**You**: That tracks with her personality.

**Other**: Which actually gives me really what I want.

**You**: Yep. But the goal of closing this matter.

**Other**: Yeah. Not only did.

**You**: We're citing a settlement agreement.

**Other**: I get what I want, but I also improve and write in who I think you are, so.

**You**: Yep. And.

**Other**: I.

**You**: I think anybody with have a brain reading the thread also got that message.

**Other**: Think so too.

**You**: Because I barely skipped the thread, and it was pretty clear. Whatever. But is it really you're getting the money, like, send it to me or whatever?

**Other**: That's the way it was written. Yeah. That I might have to go to the bank and have all the wires sent out. Just super annoying, but it's just one of those things I wasn't going to negotiate in the contract. You know, it's like. Yeah, it. Whatever. Thanks for the $100,000.

**You**: Is that about what it is?

**Other**: I think the total is, like 150. And then I. But I think they've received, like, 100 of it or so.

**You**: Got. Cha.

**Other**: So there's still some outstanding money because basically the way it's written is like, she should have been sending that to me immediately. Not waiting for all of this like, they have, like. A few days or like 15 days or something to send it to me when they receive it. But, like, I'm not busting their balls on that.

**You**: No.

**Other**: But they didn't want to be, like, sending out, you know, eight wires every month. Every time they receive one of those.

**You**: So why is it come in stages like that? Is that just the way the government.

**Other**: I'm like, Well. It's because it's different states, different years of the tax returns. Some are the amended returns, some of the. Just the normal tax return from 2025. So just each one's on a different schedule.

**You**: Interest. Ing. Well, I think Angular updates coming out this week, for what it's worth.

**Other**: Yeah. So I think my. Cool.

**You**: 98% now grinding my gears against two little things. What else do we have going on?

**Other**: Let's see. We have the trd for the integration. I mean, that is, technically. We're waiting for the ELT team to approve. The grd, so we've got that.

**You**: Do you want? Jenna and I are working on trd. Do you want to follow along to learn? Or just look at the results.

**Other**: Yeah. Probably be helpful.

**You**: Depending on how hard it is to find time. Scheduling, my week's kind of nuts. And. I've got ultrasound tomorrow. Alex has a doctor. Wait a minute. Wednesday? Pretty late in the day. But I'm going to miss an hour. And then something's gone on Friday. I can't remember what. Oh, next week I'm going to go to the damn New York City thing. I'm going to meet this new salesperson. But I'm still the one presenting. At. I don't even know what.

**Other**: If it wasn't up against the board meeting, I would have come out to that or tried to advocate for that.

**You**: Oh, yeah, that's right.

**Other**: Get to go to the board meeting.

**You**: Are you going to or me joining?

**Other**: Get to.

**You**: Remotely.

**Other**: It's. This one is in Southern California at the office. And so they're having us all come in person.

**You**: Oh, cool.

**Other**: So I think I'm going to take over a little bit of. I don't know. They talked about maybe having me do some of Jason. Part of Jason. I didn't do. I didn't say anything other than hello after the last one.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: Or at the last one. And then maybe this time I'll present a little bit.

**You**: Oh, James said that he heard that you were going to be my boss. In the inter. Im.

**Other**: James.

**You**: Yeah, I don't know where I heard that.

**Other**: Oh, james. Yeah, I don't either.

**You**: Yeah. He said he's going to work for Andrea. Randy and Ellen are going to work for Brent. And I'm going to work for you. Perfect.

**Other**: News to me, but whatever. So nothing's changing.

**You**: I told you how much I like having a screw off for a boss.

**Other**: Exactly.

**You**: It barely does. What's going on? Best cut of oz.

**Other**: Check and check.

**You**: I was snowboarding. You actually get to go.

**Other**: Great man.

**You**: Good.

**Other**: Other than, like. You know, I'm the oldest one there, and I'm like,

**You**: Yeah. Realizing how old you are?

**Other**: Dude. Feeling the 41 man, I am sore. And my legs were cramping at the end. It just freaking wiped. It was good. I mean, it's just. It's. It's really cool to have, like. And we have 15 guys go.

**You**: These guys from church or something, or old friends.

**Other**: Probably. Yeah, guys. Some turrets, nine to 10 of us, actually snowboarded or skied. Some of them just stayed at the cabin just to chill the weekend. You know, it's like one of the guys, he's not a professional chef, but he's pretty close. He like, he works in the wine industry and he cooked for us, and so he. He bought like a 16 pound prime rib roast and dry aged it at his house in his own fridge. For two weeks and, like, just, like, homemade chili from scratch. Made these, like, insane things for breakfast. You know, there's another guy who's a winemaker. He just, like, brings. He just brought, like, all this wine, and, you know, he's like, oh, yeah, this is, like, $125 bottle. Blah, blah, blah. No, this is. You know, it's like, what? It's kind of wild.

**You**: I feel like we missed out on. Some part of life where you develop. I think you and I do pretty good job of, for example. Eating well, finding good restaurants, knowing what we like. Our New York favorites. They're some of the best in the world. Still, I think.

**Other**: Oh, yeah.

**You**: But. I never. Brought that into hobby territory. It's just like dinner. Let's go somewhere great. Or it never became. And I always attributed it to, well, my spare time.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: Often in my spare energy, really kind of went to JumpRope because it was my hobby and my job. I just never developed out these hobbies. Or these living well kind of things that seem really nice when people have them. They also sound pretty expensive and time consuming.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: But I don't know. I don't know if I missed out on something or if I dodged a bullet there.

**Other**: Yeah. I wonder a similar thing. Like, I have, like, so many of these. My friends like one of them. And I think part of this is just, like, his job is super easy. But like, both him and his wife work. They both work from home somehow. They have three children that they don't pay for child care for, like. They both split, watching the kids and working. And they have like a 2500 square foot house that they've completely like, gut renovated over the last two to three years while they've lived there. And he's like, like, he's like near professional, level, level mountain climber. Like he broke his thumb and won a climbing contest like, a week later. Like with. A thumb that needed surgery because he completely torn a tendon in it. And, like, he climbs for a couple hours every few days at the gym, and I'm like, how the do you have time for all of this?

**You**: Yeah. How do you have time for that?

**Other**: I don't. I genuinely don't understand. And, like, almost every single one of the guys. Is, like, super into board games. Like, like.

**You**: Yeah, that's the thing. I run into with all my guy friends now, too.

**Other**: Every single one of them, except for me. I'm the only one there who's like, I just don't give a. Like.

**You**: It's funny is that's the only activity that the 10 guys in our group get together for is poker and board games, and I don't give a fuck about either.

**Other**: And I'm just like. Like, I. Like they were showing up and they were like. We were, like, playing this game. And one of them's like, oh, my daughter plays this game with us. He was, like, 8 years old. Like, same. Like, ages, Elliot. And. And he's like. I was like, how complicated is this game? Because I'm like, I'm tired. He's like, it's a three. And he's explaining the game, and I'm like, this is a four. At least a five. And he keeps explaining, keeps playing. I'm like, this is like a nine. I'm out of here. Like, I just. Like, I like Farkle.

**You**: My brain doesn't have room for fake rules, for fake universes, for fake fun. I'm glad you have joy out of it. I'm a little sad I can't join you, but I just can't. I can't suspend my disbelief and enjoy.

**Other**: E.

**You**: A board game for three hours. That takes an hour of learning. Before you can even play. Yeah. I'm in the same boat as you. And I don't. I mean, my friend group has been totally picked apart here, and I was always sort of secondary because they were mostly AJ's friends who got married. And so I was friends with their husbands or whatever. Yeah.

**Other**: It's really hard to, like. Pretend to care. I like to play, Farkle.

**You**: Y.

**Other**: Like, give me something easy that I can do while drinking and socializing that.

**You**: Ep. Exactly. I want to be able to be kind of drunk and talking about stuff and then, you know, get sloppy and throw dice and make jokes. Yeah.

**Other**: I don't, because I. You know, it's like then you're just. You're sitting there in silence as you're all staring at this board game, trying to figure out what the you should be doing. And no matter how smart you are, you haven't played the game enough, and you haven't. Played enough games. Like, once you start to play lots and lots of games, you start to realize there's a pattern and a structure to these games. And so then you start to see how certain games are like other games, and so you pick them up faster, and it's like, no matter what,

**You**: Exactly.

**Other**: I am not going to be winning these games.

**You**: Yeah. I'm not going to clear the hump of like. Yeah. Totally.

**Other**: So then I just feel like now people who are not as smart as me are whooping my ass in games that I don't care about and.

**You**: So I tend to just drink more and be an asshole is my strategy. So I stopped going to these nights.

**Other**: It's exactly.

**You**: Because that's fun for me, but not for everybody else. Because I could destroy a board game if you wanted to play. If you're going to make me play.

**Other**: It's really easy to exactly. Oh, man. I've done that to Laura a few times where I'm, you know, playing it. It's like everybody sitting there playing their offensive game, and I'm like, I'm you up there. Oh, I see what you're doing. I'm going to up your game, and I'm gonna up your game.

**You**: I have an agent of chaos.

**Other**: And then everybody's all, like, just super pissed. And then you're like, oh, look here. I can connect all these moves that I made, and I'm gonna win.

**You**: You're not playing the game, right? I'm like, yeah, I'm following the rules, guys. Tell me what rule I'm breaking.

**Other**: Yeah. You're not playing it according to the customs of people who play games nicely with each other.

**You**: Well, you know what? In this game, I'm going to go on disability and just mooch off the safety net. At least you got snowboarding.

**Other**: Yeah. That's nice. And all snow was decent. Like it was cold and it snowed a bunch.

**You**: Up on hood.

**Other**: No, we've been actually going to the last two years. We went to White Pass, which is up.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: Off a Highway 12. Like between wherever Highway 12 connects. Into i5 and like Yakimoff.

**You**: Y. Eah.

**Other**: It's a tiny little resort. You know, it's like. It's got two high speed quads, two low speed quads, and like a beginner lift. It's got some decent terrain. With good snow. It's pretty fun. And then just, like, going up with 10 guys in a crew, it's just freaking hysterical. And, like, I. Actually, it's like, it's very funny because individually, like, one on one, I don't have, like, any really. Like, nobody's really close. Like, I don't. I don't have, like, any side text conversations with any of them. I don't ever hang out with any of them one on one, right? But, like, as a group, they're really fun. You've got a little bit of everything, right? Like, one guy's a friggin. Chemistry physics professor George Fox, and he's like, 65 and super nerdy, but, like, also kind of funny. And a couple of the younger guys all went to college together, and they're just your typical, like, really rowdy, just like, like. Beating the. Out of each other wrestling, and it's like, you know, and it's just dick jokes. And so it's like a balance of, like, just total juvenile humor. But then also, everybody can be really serious, and everybody, almost. Almost all of the guys are either dads are about to be dads. I think. Only one of the guys wasn't married. He's recently divorced. So it's just like. I don't know, it's just like a really interesting mix where it's like, oh, man, you guys can be serious. You can, you know, have really intentional, meaningful conversations, but also, like, you know, half. Of our text thread was just dick jokes, so it's like, not. Not what I'm used to having in terms of, like. Guy friends at a church. Usually it's just boring. So at least they're not boring. Feel like boring is nice is about the worst compliments you could give, and boring is about the worst insult.

**You**: It's funny. One observation I had in my group of friends here, there's a lot of us guys and girls that have pretty interesting jobs. But we almost never really talk about them because I think when your job gets. Think about our job. It takes so much conversation for me to bring anybody close enough to have a meaningful conversation about what I really am dealing with. It feels like that you just don't bother. And one guy's a media executive for Sony, whatever record studios. He's pretty high up, and he's like, I'm sure. Some really interesting job.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: It's just miles away from what I know or care about.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: You can have these little vignettes where you're sitting there and just having a ten minute conversation. And relating to each other on something that makes it clear that you both have serious jobs that are important and whatever, but it's not like you're tracking their career, their issues they deal with, because it's so complex.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: You know what I mean?

**Other**: It's not like, like, Laura sits there and texts with all of her friends constantly. And so they all know that, like, oh, Johnny was shooting his pants yesterday and.

**You**: Right? Because everybody can relate to parenting on that thread.

**Other**: Well, and everybody has. They all. All the stay at home. I tried to tell this to Lauren. She didn't. She couldn't wrap her mind around this. I was like, You have such an easier time with all of your friends because they're all stay at home moms. Or at the very least, moms. And so, like, that's your primary job? Like you all have the same job. Like.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: There's no other. Like, there's a couple other guys. There's actually two other guys who own their own businesses, so they're. They're always really interesting to talk to. But, like, for the most part, I'm like, everybody has a very different job. And so none of us connect because none of us have the same job and none of us have any overlapping responsibilities at our jobs. So, like. Like you said, it's a lot of work to, like, get to a place where you could actually have a conversation about it. That's not just describing what you do. And no and, like.

**You**: I didn't even have trouble talking to AJ about it because it's hard to keep her up to speed with everything's going on.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And I kind of always loved that because I don't want my with AJ to be talking about work a lot.

**Other**: And it's not. Yeah. Well, then that's the other side of it. It's like, I don't necessarily want to talk. Like there's no benefit to me to talk about work. With most of these guys because they're not going to have anything to tell, to say to me. And we're not going to talk frequently enough that you're, like, building something. It's just, like, something to do. It's not.

**You**: Of. Yeah. Yeah, like if I do a really good job of explaining myself, I could do one one hour conversation where the person would eventually say, yeah, that sounds tough. They wouldn't have any advice.

**Other**: And so.

**You**: Or if they had advice, I wouldn't listen to it because I wouldn't trust that they knew it, though they were talking about.

**Other**: Exactly. Yeah, it's kind of funny. And I just. I was like. And that's why it's so much easier for you and to, like, make friends and build relationships than it is for me. And she was like, yeah. I don't think so. I'm like, okay, fine, whatever. But then her whole friend group group blew up because girls were also tons of drama and stupid.

**You**: Yeah. Jeez.

**Other**: And it's really funny at work, or not work, but at church, like, the guys are all pretty close. Like, you know, there's probably between 15 to 20 of us that are fairly close, and the wives are not. There's, like, drama and there's personality quirks that don't fit. And so and so wants to plan an event, but so and so wants to be the host. But so, you know, but like, the person who wants to host all the events. All. Everybody who wants to host events lives in a tiny apartment. Or house, you know, and it's like. It's just, you know. And then somebody planned an event last year, but they were pregnant and. But somebody else wanted to plan it this year, and it's just like, oh, my gosh, girls. Just figured your out.

**You**: But that's the thing is, like, it's the same reason that it's easy for them to connect. Is that being a mom is their job. That's the reason these things are important. Because that is the most important. That's the job. You know what I mean? You see what I mean?

**Other**: Yeah, yeah.

**You**: It's a double edged sword, I guess.

**Other**: That's funny.

**You**: Okay, well.

**Other**: All that to say? Good weekend.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: I told Laura, I'm like, well, it's been one year since I've exercised. Because that was the last time that I'd exercised, was the last time that I did this snowboarding trip.

**You**: So what are you doing for your surgery? Now.

**Other**: I don't know. Still. Like we send. This is. I'm supposedly on my last wire for my orthodontics. Whatever that means. I don't know, because I think that. She's. So I get scanned next, like the beginning of next February. And then we'll send those scans to the surgeon. And then the surgeon will decide from the scans if it wants any other movements to the T. And then we can. And I think at that point, they'll know kind of like when they think they could schedule surgery for. My hope is like early May. Because that. That gives me my biggest gap of travel. Like, I have no work travel from May. To like the qso again in september. And that way my whole, like, modified. Food decks. I'm on a liquid diet for ever. And then, you know, and then like a soft food diet. I mean, for like, four months, I'll probably be on, like, some kind of modified food diet. And I just would really rather not be traveling for work during any of that. I haven't. I haven't told Aries yet. Just because I feel like there's just not a lot of information. I was going to tell Brent in our one on one last week, but then I realized he didn't have them scheduled into this calendar year. And hasn't rescheduled them, and he's. Busy as can be, so. Because he's basically taking on a lot of the responsibilities from. JSON and jennifer leaving.

**You**: Passing.

**Other**: So I don't really know, but, I mean, I'm probably going to need, like, two to three weeks off to recover.

**You**: Yeah, I've been trying to figure out what the hell their parental leave policy is up in here.

**Other**: I mean, right now it's nothing. I mean, it's just whatever's required by law, which is like 12 weeks unpaid, but it sounds like they're doing something that has some paid to it. All. They're like. All of their policy stuff is so out of date. Like, I actually read through the policies, and it's like. You know, they're talking about booking travel through this other thing and reimbursements and whatnot.

**You**: Yeah, well.

**Other**: I'm curious because, like, the policy around travel is, like, you're supposed to book it through Brex. But, like, there's a part of me that's like that. Can't actually be the case, like. I'm like, it makes so much more sense to book it on your own. Car. You get the perks and the benefits of, like, checking bags for free and getting better seats.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: And I'm kind of curious to see how strict they are about that. And, like, you're not supposed. Like, you could pay for your own upgraded seat, but you're not supposed to, like. Charge that to the company, but I'm kind of like, I kind of want the extra leg room.

**You**: I don't fit.

**Other**: And. I'm like, if you pay for the extra legroom, I can actually open my laptop in the seat. If you don't.

**You**: Right. It's a no brainer.

**Other**: I can't open my laptop. And I won't work. In a non extended leg room seat.

**You**: Totally. Yeah, that's exactly true for me.

**Other**: Everybody on the team seems to be happy, or at least not upset. I think.

**You**: You mean, given where they landed and all that?

**Other**: Yeah. I think everybody's a little, like. A little bit more communication and a little more. I mean, it's kind of like what we talked about with, like, the Ace leadership or this or that. It's, like, constantly. I'm, like, not included on things. And, you know, or not, it's. It's like we were never properly onboarded as employees. To process and procedures and the way that things work at Aries. And so there's just a lot of, like, kind of trying to struggle along and figure it out. Which, on the one hand, I like. I feel like when I first came on, I'm like, I'm fine. I don't need to go to any of these meetings that I don't know what they are, and I don't care. But now I'm starting to feel now that technically nobody reports me. And my plan is to eventually move my check ins with people to, like, every other week. But even still, I'm like, I'm kind of concerned about renewals this year, like, you know, from. Technically that. 's Jumer's responsibility is renewals. But like I've always done it. And, you know, we have a pretty streamlined process for that built into our salesforce instance. And, like, my concern is that, you know, Jennifer was, like, You know, hey. Give us all the information we need. To, like, figure out how to migrate. You know, the data. And I'm like, well, there's more than just data. There's all these different business processes that we do and are used to having. Like, when Stacy goes to Bill, she's looking at, are they using the software? As, like a check. You know, there's all these different process things that we just kind of have built in that, like. I don't know what happens. To those. In the event that, like, Our Salesforce instance goes like. I think they. You know, it's again, it's just that, like, they do it their way, and it's like salesforce is for sales. Like nobody else uses Salesforce, just the sales team. And it's like salesforce was becoming kind of a hub for us of where our teams would communicate.

**You**: Yeah, the other thing I was gonna noticing, or at least from what I've heard. Their logo count isn't that much bigger than ours. It's like 300 or something. To our 200. You see, when I'm going here is like, they haven't actually had to think about trying to automate renewals, probably because they have 10 times as many people working with just not that many more customers because they have bigger customers.

**Other**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep, exactly.

**You**: And they don't have to deal with these $5,000 a year renewals that you don't want to spend $1,000 working on.

**Other**: Well, they have them, but it's like, You. They know if somebody. Well, and there's a few things that are different for them. One is their contracts expire all the time throughout the year.

**You**: Got it.

**Other**: Even though they're onboarding, the contract might start in November when you signed. And then there's onboarding, and then there's the renewal the next November. Right. So there's like. There's just some different way that. Like that. Sort of works. Whereas, like all of ours are all at once. And we don't. Know ahead of time.

**You**: And they do because there's probably been an RFP out they lost or. Interesting.

**Other**: Exactly. Yeah. So ours is high stakes and comes very fast. But it's also a pretty low touch, the way that we have it set up right now.

**You**: But if they take away that low touch thing, It's problematic.

**Other**: Exactly.

**You**: And then you got to worry about your Maris a little bit. Because in a weird way, it doesn't actually fall on us. If renewals are bad this year, you and me.

**Other**: Yeah, well, and Jennifer had said to me kind of offhand,

**You**: All of a.

**Other**: And she was like, yeah, I'm going to probably put Jumes in charge of renewals. And I'm, you know, I'm really gonna. I'm gonna task her with, you know, bringing that renewal rate up to 95%. And like you. Like, you know how hard we've worked to get that to the almost 92% that it is like. There's no way your meris is gonna get that up to 95%.

**You**: Yeah. One of the things I've realized a few months. Is. There just isn't any low hanging crude at JumpRope because we already picked it.

**Other**: Oh, yeah.

**You**: The only thing that might be is boots on the ground salesperson in New York. That might be one thing that gets traction.

**Other**: Y. Ep. Very curious to see how that goes.

**You**: Because we've just never really tried it. Can't count seamus or rodney.

**Other**: Exactly.

**You**: But yeah. And it's not that everything is perfectly optimized, but it's optimized to reason within reason. It is at our scale. It doesn't make sense to get more optimal in most even like our AWS spend.

**Other**: Yeah. Y. Eah.

**You**: You're at diminishing returns. If I spend all my fucking time on my aws. Spend.

**Other**: We're not at the scale where that made sense. But yeah, squeezing out renewals is not going to like. It's just not something that you can like, like. To say that we could drive that much, that much of an increase in renewals is to say that, like, there's really something we weren't doing before to renew.

**You**: Exactly that we were sucking at renewals. And.

**Other**: And I think we were operating at peak performance in terms of renewals. Like, we had addressed all the, like, main concerns. Like, we, we were doing everything. Except I think, like, significant playbook work around admin turnover. Like anything that we were going to be doing was going to be putting serious, like, long term customer success work to make sure that customers didn't like and even that it's only going to be big customers. Right? It's like,

**You**: Exactly.

**Other**: And I mean, our renewals last year. I mean, gosh, if we hadn't, you know. Bryant and Van Wyt. Right? Our number one and our number five largest customer. Other than that, we hadn't lost a single other customer. Those are the only two in our top 50 that we lost. If we hadn't lost those two, if we could have lost like 45 and 50 instead of one in five. Like we would have had just an amazing renewal year.

**You**: Even three in 10 would have made a pretty big difference, probably.

**Other**: Yeah. Exactly. It really would have.

**You**: Yeah, Bryant was just a kick in the face. But I actually think I'm kind of happy it happened when it did.

**Other**: That was.

**You**: Because it was on our radar during the negotiations.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Somebody from Newburgh, Oregon is calling them.

**Other**: Sure isn't me. It's weird.

**You**: I like to answer. Hit the keypad, push some buttons and go on mute. And see what happens. Pretty much anytime I get a call from a 503 number, it's just spam. Because it's actually great to have a number that's different area code than anybody who'd actually call you.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: That you don't know. Because anytime it's unknown from 503, it's definitely.

**Other**: Oh, this number looks like it's similar to my number. It must be something important.

**You**: Oh. Man. It must be my cousin. I tell you? This was maybe a year ago. Now, but I got a pretty sophisticated. Phishing attempt on my Coinbase account. I have, like, 5,000. In crypto or whatever.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And. I got a text message that looked fairly real, but like, unknown number, hard to verify what a number? Is on your phone and they didn't send an email.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And then it's like, oh, there's been an internal breach at Coinbase. We're reaching out to affected customers when you need to verify. Your identity, and so you're asking me questions about myself. And I'm in my head. I wasn't suspicious at the very beginning, so I don't know, I was distracted. That's how they get you is like you're distracted, you want to go away.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: But, like, the red flags just kept piling up. They're like. Okay, can you verify the balance you have in Coinbase? Open the app. You don't know my balance. He's like, well, one way we can verify that you have access to proper cows that you know the balance. And I was like, okay. So I quoted on the wrong balance.

**Other**: Y.

**You**: And I kept going. I'm like, okay, let's get fucking. Idiot.

**Other**: Eah.

**You**: Anyway, I went from, like, 20 minutes with him just to see how far they would go.

**Other**: Fascinating just to see.

**You**: And they ended up getting to the point where, like, okay, so here's what we're gonna need to do. To keep it safe through the breach. We need you to transfer it to your personal wallet, and we're gonna exchange a key. So it's encrypted. That's as far as this is gonna go. I've been onto you for 15 minutes. And then he tried to keep it up. Keep it. Up, he's like, okay. I'm report it. I've got some information from you. If you call me back. I'm not gonna answer. Have a nice day. I didn't report it. I shouldn't.

**Other**: Y. Eah. That's. Funny. Oh, and if there was a breach, like, they're just calling you randomly or like.

**You**: Know. I'm pretty sure there's ways to. Determine who. Has which apps installed on their phone and shit. That don't raise to the security incident level.

**Other**: Or even, like. Like, I get JumpRope. I got texts. Like, I'll get texts about JumpRope. Shit. I'm just getting so much more JumpRope stuff to my personal email. Like, spam. Like, everybody. Like, they're like, oh, we could open up a line of credit for your JumpRope. I'm like you. It would not surprise me if they're just like,

**You**: Speaking of, I was in.

**Other**: Finding people in tech.

**You**: Chase business, and I still have access to all those accounts, and there's, like, a million bucks in there. Chase business account still? Is that expected?

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah.

**You**: Maybe notice it was gone.

**Other**: Yeah. Stacy would notice.

**You**: Probably juliet.

**Other**: At some point. Well, what's so funny is, like, I was supposed to create accounts for everybody. And like I did, and then nobody logged in. So nobody actually has them. So if they actually want to get access, I don't think that anybody's actually, like, taken access to their accounts. And there's a part of me that's like, do you want me to, like, put the cash in a CD? Like, we made $20,000 last year doing that, like. Can I just, like.

**You**: You could make more than you're gonna save on all this AWS shit if you just put our money in a cd.

**Other**: Right. Exactly.

**You**: Yeah, we know too much to. Like. I don't know. I think that's the thing that's gonna be hardest for me to. I'm never gonna be a great employee because I know too much about my boss's jobs. Now, not necessarily at this company or whatever, but I just have too much of a 360 degree view of what's going on.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: In general. At a company and what motivates different people.

**Other**: Exactly.

**You**: What you're saying. Just doesn't add up. I see more variables than you do right now. Jason. But, yeah, I agree with you that.

**Other**: Yeah, well, it's like the roadmap for comms, right? It's like. What the were you thinking?

**You**: Yeah. I'm even concerned that. Somebody in the ELT could interpret that as logical, if that's how they understood it. Brent should have been able to pick up on that. Problem there.

**Other**: Like. And I'm wondering where the mistake came from. Did that mistake come from Brent or did it come from Jason?

**You**: Y. Eah. Well, now that Jason's got it came from Jason.

**Other**: Came from Jason, didn't it? I know. I thought about just, like. Like, explicitly asking Brent if I should just say that, like, just. Just to, like.

**You**: At the board meeting.

**Other**: Smooth things over on that whole front. Too. Funny.

**You**: All right, well. I'm gonna wrap up a couple things and then try and join this ACE leadership meeting. In half an hour.

**Other**: So yeah.

**You**: Probably won't stay the whole time.

**Other**: I got that.

**You**: When Jen and I are gonna schedule some time. To dig into technical requirements. I'll try and make it at a time that works for you. Too. It's not like you have to be there all the time, but.

**Other**: I can move anything too. Like, if I have a one on one, I could move it. That's not. A problem, so. If it's not. If it. If there's not an obvious time and it's like over one of my one on ones with somebody, like, I've. I have no problem. Moving those. I.

**You**: Okie doke.

**Other**: Could be flexible. All right.

**You**: Talk to you later.

**Other**: Talk to you later.
