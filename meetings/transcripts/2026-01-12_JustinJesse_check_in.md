## Transcript

**Other**: What's up? A wild couple of days.

**You**: Yeah, I guess.

**Other**: I mean, it doesn't really change anything, I guess.

**You**: Is it bad that my first thought was it was kind of nice working for a checked out boss. It can also be great working for an effective boss. I guess we'll find out.

**Other**: One of the. Yeah, exactly. One of the other. As long as it's not ineffective. Micromanaging, boss.

**You**: See, I'm hopping on with the director soon. It sounds like maybe Randy's going to kind of take the reins for a bit, but if you want to give me any context that might help me figure out how. To.

**Other**: I mean, they're basically with both of them, it sounds like they're, you know, with both Jennifer and Jason. It's like they're looking like. So I was just on the executive leadership meeting where they have their new chief revenue officer.

**You**: He was there today.

**Other**: And they're just. Yeah, I mean, they're just looking for more senior people to run this show. Like they're looking to hire a cto, CPO kind of person. Which I think it was very reassuring.

**You**: Yeah, that is the right move.

**Other**: Yeah. I mean, I just think I don't know what Jason was doing, but.

**You**: I don't know big companies, but I know they had problems they couldn't solve. With Jason there, I think.

**Other**: Yeah. So I. I mean, I don't know. Can't speak to Jennifer's performance, but I just didn't like her. So I was thrilled to see her gone and.

**You**: Yep. And I'd love for product to actually start being effective, and I didn't sing a path to that, really, with Jason. There. Sweet.

**Other**: Yeah. So they don't have a product person. Signed yet.

**You**: But they have a person as close to signing.

**Other**: But engineering. They have a few people that I think are val are like legitimate candidates for the position that.

**You**: Okay? Interest. Ing.

**Other**: But, I mean, it sounds like it could be up to a month before they're signed on hired.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: You know?

**You**: Interesting. I wonder if they're just gonna let Randy seems to be the one that would kind of run the show. But it could also be Ellen.

**Other**: Yeah. I mean, it sounds like Brent is kind of even going to step in a little bit, which I don't know what that means, but.

**You**: You have any thoughts that it should be you?

**Other**: Do you have? A. No, I don't. No. I don't want. To. I don't. Have the. I would say it'd be more likely to be you than me.

**You**: Yeah. I mean, you and I would. Be quickly discarded but considered in people's brains, you know what I mean?

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Definitely not.

**Other**: No. I don't want it.

**You**: Right now anyway.

**Other**: I, I. 'm excited at the idea that if we might.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: To actually have somebody, some leadership at the company that I feel like I could learn something from.

**You**: Y. Eah. I agree.

**Other**: Like it's. It's definitely changed. My. It's given me a little bit more of a positive outlook on Aeries, so.

**You**: Yeah. I. Agree. Is the Chief Revenue Officer. What's your impression? There.

**Other**: I mean, I just got a real short introduction, but he's got a great resume. And seems like just an older dude. I don't know if this is sexist or makes me a terrible person, but I just. I don't know. Just something about having working for, you know, I don't know. Jennifer was just very prickly.

**You**: I'll tell you, by the way, I've always kind of. Hillary Clinton made me face the question of am I sexist at some point. Early on, like in 2014 or something. I don't remember, but, like, the idea was basically. I don't have a problem with women, but I have a problem with the way women need to be to get to those roles in our society.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: It's almost like you have to take on certain personality or you have to have certain traits.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

**You**: To overcome what is sexism, and I don't like that those traits exist. Period. And so most women in leadership have them. And they're not great. Perspective, which makes me.

**Other**: Yeah. Yep.

**You**: Like, yeah, that's borderline sexist. But also.

**Other**: Y. Eah. But also, it's just what it is.

**You**: And it doesn't mean everybody. I'm sure there are people who avoid that.

**Other**: But, like.

**You**: So it's just harder.

**Other**: Yeah. But it's like I don't get that same. Like. Like, you don't. I don't know, like, I don't totally get that from Andrea. I could do a little bit less from Laura.

**You**: I agree. Yeah, not everybody has that. I think sales is its own kind of monster. Probably.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: It's totally different than CFO. CFO's job is to organize and squeeze dollars and cents. It's not to drive growth, per se. I don't know.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: Whatever. We don't need to come to a conclusion on that. Jennifer sucked.

**Other**: Y. Eah. But I think we're. Yeah, exactly. So. Anyways. I think it's. It's good signs. It's just gonna mean more work for me. But they approved splitting up the messaging into two different BRDs. Which is good. The grade book or the integration BRD should be approved by the end of the week.

**You**: Co. Ol?

**Other**: That's all been submitted. And then, yeah. So things are moving forward.

**You**: All right. So do I report to Brent now? I guess they'll tell us at this meeting in a few minutes, probably.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: In teams. It actually says you're my manager right now. I don't know if that's as of today.

**Other**: Yeah, in teams. It's not in. It's not an adp. It's appropriate, it's set up properly.

**You**: It was jason.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: It's interesting. As soon as you told me that, I glanced in my team's activity, I was like, oh, maybe somebody told us. Go on. The activity I got was, I have been made the owner of my one on one meeting with Jason. And then Jason's not on it, and so I was like, okay.

**Other**: This was just.

**You**: So some things happen automatically when you remove somebody from teams that announce what's going on, in case anybody needs to know that.

**Other**: Yeah. That's funny.

**You**: Why can't I mention jason? Very well. Yeah, I'm encouraged by this. It shows some. Recognition of the issues and some degree of. I don't know. Boldness or constitution to do something about it. I was curious if this was coming from. I don't know. Is your sense that Jason, Andrea and Jonathan have been talking about this for months.

**Other**: I think so. Like, I don't think this is just the way that Andrea. Talked to me at the qso about. Jennifer maybe. Maybe not being around. I took it as more of like Jennifer's looking for a new thing, but I think it's more.

**You**: Yeah. You mean it was already on the table in September is what you're saying.

**Other**: Coming from the other direction.

**You**: And they waited till January to do it. I think that's what happened too.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: I also wonder if. That could have nerfed what the ELT was doing about product problems for a while. You know what I mean? They're like, well, fuck it, we're just getting rid of Jason, so we're just going to wait it out.

**Other**: A little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

**You**: And so maybe they're better than we think they are. Given that context or something, I don't know.

**Other**: It could be. Yeah.

**You**: All right.

**Other**: I'm not. Not entirely sure. But.

**You**: Well, it barely affects me. Honestly, it might when the new person comes in, but Jason's just letting me do my thing.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And I haven't talked to him.

**Other**: Exactly.

**You**: Other than watching him fumble teams in a month.

**Other**: I said that? Jonathan and Brent were talking to me about it. And they were like, he hasn't met with Jesse, like, at all? And I was like, nope. And they were like, wow, that's really good to know. Thanks.

**You**: I mean, we did in September and early October. We had like three or four one on ones. And it just hasn't happened since. Different reason every time.

**Other**: Yeah. Totally. So, yeah, I mean. Overall, I actually think it's pretty encouraging. I think we can. Get. Get this, get our projects moving and.

**You**: Yeah. What's interesting now is. In a way. I was thinking about this with sales last week, and now I'm kind of thinking about the product. Is. Prior to these moves, JumpRope was the new thing. We're trying to fit in. With these new people coming in. Jumper's part of Aeries. From their perspective a little bit. More, right? And maybe I don't know what I'm trying to get out of that other than. A fresh set of eyes that isn't. As pre biased to the way Ares does stuff.

**Other**: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**You**: That might take.

**Other**: Yep.

**You**: Our description of how we work. With a little bit less of. Well, that's not how we do things here. But more of like, that's actually a pretty good way to do things.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah, that is interesting to think about.

**You**: Do you have any sense that Jim or Laura or anybody else is up on the block?

**Other**: I don't think so. I mean, not. Definitely not Laura. She's by far their most competent vp, and I think that Jim.

**You**: Agreed she couldn't go. Well and she holds it part of institutional knowledge, Jim. I don't. I like Jim, but he doesn't really say or do much, as far as I can tell.

**Other**: He's behind the scenes. So Jim has actually been my go to person when I need help.

**You**: Okay? Interesting.

**Other**: So I've chatted with him a few times. He was like, hey, reach out if you need anything. So, like, I will. Like, after the qso, I called him and was like, dude. I'm concerned about the capacity stuff going on. And, like, he, you know, we chatted through all of that, and that was. That was helpful. And. And then with the messaging stuff, I was like, hey. You know what? This is what I want to do. How do I approach this? Like, what should I do to bring this up to the lt? So he. He's kind of, like, in the same way that Alicia is, like, super helpful for us to, like, just make sure we're doing whatever the we're supposed to do.

**You**: Cool.

**Other**: He? He's that for me at the higher level.

**You**: Yeah. I agree. That was my last kind of wondering is Alicia. I used to think she came in with Jim, but she came in with Jason.

**Other**: Which is great. I thought so, too. Yeah, exactly. I asked. I actually talked to Jonathan about that. And I don't. They've said that she's actually talked to them about. Challenges with Jace.

**You**: Yeah, she's talked to me about challenges with Jason. I just wasn't quite sure how deep the personal loyalty went and all that.

**Other**: Her loyalties. Yeah, exactly.

**You**: Because I don't want to lose her right now. Not that I think she's, like a superstar in what she's doing for the company, necessarily, but she's extremely helpful for me.

**Other**: Yes. Just from what her role is and her personality and the way that she interacts with us, I feel like. She's. She's so helpful. Yeah. Not because. Of. Not necessarily exactly because of competence or anything, but just because of.

**You**: And it might. She might be confident. I can't really tell if she is. She mostly just complains that Aeries doesn't do what she wants them to. But we do. But it's useful to me.

**Other**: Yeah. Exactly.

**You**: So I was hoping she wouldn't for the door. Because you, like, think about it with the JumpRope team. And there's a couple exceptions and ways. This might not fall that way, but I think a couple of us left, the rest would go too.

**Other**: I think so.

**You**: At least if it happened now. We might be able to make that more stable. In the next. Well, hey, stuff's happening. And you know what?

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: I don't have a sinking feeling in my chest. I don't have any sadness.

**Other**: No, it feels.

**You**: I mean, not even on the human level. Jason's got a fuck ton of money. His kids are in college, he's fine. I don't know what Jennifer's financial situation is. But at the vp when you get that high and above, I don't feel bad when people get pushed out. Because, you know, they have money and they got packages. So it's not like you're worried about their kids and their family.

**Other**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think at this level. You just need to assume, like I think you. You should. Like I think you should just assume to have you need to have six months of expenses saved. Because it could take you a long time to find a job.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: Like, I think. I don't know. To me, that's just like. It's not. It's not even a question. It's just, you know, these kind of things take. It takes time to get those positions filled.

**You**: And I don't know how much money he has, but I know some things about his lifestyle and I know some things about his past. And he's worked at big companies that have successful exits, and there's no way you don't walk away with. Some money for most of those things.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah.

**You**: Well. I guess I'm going to go hop on. A call and see.

**Other**: Does it make sense for me to join that? I asked Brent about it, but he never responded.

**You**: What? I would be fine with that. I think other people might wonder why you're there.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: I don't know.

**Other**: Well, maybe I won't for now, but I actually have plenty of work to keep myself busy, so.

**You**: Yeah. I'll hit you up on slack. If I think something's going on.

**Other**: Yeah. Let me know if it makes sense or. Or whatnot.

**You**: Okay? All right. Talk to you afterwards.

**Other**: All right, talk to Lair.
