## Notes

idp vs sp-intiated: idp is low hanging fruit, sp slightly nicer flow but when clicking log in with aeries they need to click a radio button whether staff or student/family

admins can change their email address, 

they have student.counselor that “gives the counselor access to the kid”, we could maybe make this work with our advisor

TSA = is a way to directly associate teachers to kids, but may not be exposed via current API
