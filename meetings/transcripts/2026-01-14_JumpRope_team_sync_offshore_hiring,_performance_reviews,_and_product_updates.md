## Transcript

**Other**: Referencing here? Because the answer could be, don't know, neutral for everything. I have no idea what any of these people do.

**You**: I don't have a post right now to answer that about.

**Other**: Right? Right. I don't know who I'm answering about, and I don't know the people work here. Or am I answering about JumpRope? Because this is not reporting system.

**You**: Let me throw. Out.

**Other**: For your own reflection, I assume. But I bet you they at the end, they get a thing that says most of your work. You know, they probably get a graph. The best one was at work. I hear inappropriate comments intended as humor. Agree, disagree. It's like, oh, you spend our meetings, then. Intended to snore. No, it is humor. It is human. Wow. You have very different questions than I do on my self reflection. Oh, no. This is the training. This is from the training.

**You**: What's a self reflection?

**Other**: This is the harassment training. Did you not go to harassment training, Justin? I can tell. You have to do that. I ran the harassment training. It's highly entertaining.

**You**: It's in your ADP and you've got to go click through it. And you have to spend 60 minutes doing it. I finished it in 41 minutes.

**Other**: Okay? Yeah. I haven't done the 80. You got to do it. By really good friends with Ish because he has to bug me because I don't ever get anything done.

**You**: Yeah. Yeah.

**Other**: And apparently I only uploaded the back of my driver's license and not the front of it.

**You**: That seems. Did you charge it? Airbnb in Mexico. Do you JumpRope card on the third last day of the year.

**Other**: Oops. No, I just had to deal with somebody who did.

**You**: Whoops.

**Other**: Whoops.

**You**: That was me.

**Other**: Well done, you guys. I love it. That made my day.

**You**: Yeah, legitimately. It was just the suit. I've always had the problem that it's one digit off of my United Explorer card. The last four digits is one number different. And my brain cannot get it right. Every time. Every time I'm like, yeah, that's the right one, right? Or whatever, because you just see the last four digits.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And I was like, I've never done Airbnb for JumpRope, have I? But apparently I have. I didn't even think that.

**Other**: You. Probably. That's awesome.

**You**: Now I'm wondering. Now I'm wondering, jenna.

**Other**: It was not a cheap Airbnb either.

**You**: Who paid for that? Texas Airbnb. That was you, right? Okay?

**Other**: I did.

**You**: Good.

**Other**: I did.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Anyway. Justin, are we supposed to be writing a self reflection of some sort?

**Other**: Yes. Yeah. Did you hear your performance review?

**You**: Nobody's told me about. That. Nobody's talked to me about anything related to performance review.

**Other**: Nobody's talked to me. But there's an email that you didn't read.

**You**: S.

**Other**: A year end performance review. By the 19th. I get a reminder every day in my email to it.

**You**: I don't. Have anything about that. Oh, yeah, I do.

**Other**: Maybe.

**You**: You know, I think it messed up, right? I think it got messed up.

**Other**: You don't have a boss, though.

**You**: My boss got shifted to, let's see who it says I work for. Whatever. Deal with it later.

**Other**: Yeah. I haven't looked at the self reflection yet. Has anyone done it? How long is it going to take? It's going to take a while. It's not. I was afraid of that. They want authentic. Here's what you do. Well, I mean, go into ChatGPT, copy and paste all of the prompts. That's what I'm going to do. Start talking and have it write it up. I did this already. And then it takes, like, a half hour to get it all set up and do all of that. And then go through and edit it. Tell it to put it in a very casual tone. Call it a day. Call it a day. Or actually ask me to collaborate on yours, Becky, So you'll get some feedback from me. I actually thought I would offer to each of the managers to do that for each of you. I've never spoken to my manager. How is he going to give me a performance review? He's not. The day before it's due, he's going to ask me to do it. So I'm just going to offer ahead of time, take care of it. Like I said, like two hours doing mine yesterday. Actually, probably closer to three, really. I had a lot to say. You don't need to spend that much time. Okay, good. I don't know what the questions are. Maybe I'll want to, but I assume no one's going to read it. I can tell you what my questions were. So list. Oh, wait a second. I can find mine, too. They're different than. Mostly the same. Is anyone going to read it? I think so. Who? I wouldn't be surprised if they do read it. They do in Troy's company, and it's like 1100 people. These are, like, really important things at big companies. But who's going to read it? Your manager? He is. You think so? If I think somebody's actually going to read it. I might have a lot to say. Well, I think that. Here's what I'll say is that I do think that, for example, part of what you have to do is give a rating. So like poor performance below expectations. One is poor performance, two is below expectations, three is successful performance, four is exceed expectations and five exceeds performance and promotion. Ready? Sure. I remember. Give yourself a five. Nobody gets a five. Yeah.

**You**: What if I don't?

**Other**: But you get to give yourself that rating. And then they give you one, and then eight gives you. One. I don't know what their expectations are. Nobody's told. Yeah. How do I know if I'm meeting them? It's a great question.

**You**: I already did mine.

**Other**: Just do it now.

**You**: Now. I did this on January 8th. It took me 10 minutes. I don't know what the fuck you guys were doing. Or am I not done yet? Maybe.

**Other**: Herring. Caring more than you.

**You**: Yes. I only have seven questions in my self reflection.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Okay? Yeah. Each one has a sentence.

**Other**: Justin just really likes to self reflect. And you don't.

**You**: Nobody's giving me guidance on the importance or the complete.

**Other**: Well, I'm slow. And interrupted a lot. All right. I like that they hired us and then sent us our self reflection for our review three days later. No.

**You**: Well, that's why I don't give it the more respect than this. I'll give it more respect next year if I have a boss who might read it, who might know how to evaluate me, who might have some basis on which to evaluate me.

**Other**: Next year.

**You**: And until then, I'm going to give it the respect to Stew. That's how I feel about BRDs and TRDs right now, too. The respect it's due.

**Other**: Now goes the product world, friends. Who knows?

**You**: Yeah. Jason's gone. We probably won't have a replacement for several weeks is what I'm hearing. I am currently the most senior person.

**Other**: Really?

**You**: In the department. Division. By title. Just. Funny.

**Other**: Has anyone talked to Alicia since this happened?

**You**: I have not. I was thinking about reaching out to her.

**Other**: I chatted with her a little bit. About it or just. Asked how she was doing. Brent and Jonathan about her when they told me that it had happened, just to make sure that it was on their radar. Okay, good. Were they close?

**You**: Yeah, they came in together.

**Other**: He brought her on. He brought his previous. From wherever they previously worked. Wait, who? I'm. I missed it. Alicia.

**You**: She's like the project manager person.

**Other**: Pmo. What did she say? Like she. Is she. Like, was she surprised? Do you know? I don't think so. Okay? I don't think anybody should be surprised. No, I didn't either. But, you know, do you think the other directors on the product team were surprised?

**You**: I think that they were surprised. But. I'm gonna surprise that it happened. But they understood why.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Randy looks pretty shell shocked. But he's kind of looked that way to me from day one, so I'm not sure if it's related.

**Other**: Somebody made a comment the other day about Randy having had a really hard year in general, and I don't know.

**You**: He lost both of his parents recently.

**Other**: Okay? So it wasn't just work related.

**You**: I don't know the timeline. Yeah, I think that's been over the last year. There's been a lot. Personally for him. That's what I know. Anyway. Yeah, john. My self reflection. Did not take long enough for me to remember having done it.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: We'll see what happens.

**Other**: Perfect.

**You**: We'll compare it to Justin's experience later. Justin, however, probably Brent is reading it, so maybe.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Nobody's going to read yours for sure now.

**You**: Well, and if they do, they're going to be coming in with a whole bunch of them to read and no idea what's going on, and it's going to get lost in the mix.

**Other**: Alicia's not going to quit, is she? Hope. Not. Me too.

**You**: Hello, Jenna. You could just be the next Alicia if you want to get out of this product. Share. Okay. Should we talk about our product?

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Before. We.

**Other**: Couple of quick things. Aries. Integration, not product integration, people. Integration related real quick. In theory. They're going to be updating SSO this week for. Zendesk. I have not heard of PEEP since they said they were going to do it and ask me some questions a week ago though, but just as a heads up they might get their act together. This is the third time they've asked me questions and said can we do it next week? And then nothing. So who knows. And do you mean, like, they're going to put it into Duo instead of okay? They're going to make it, not Google sso. So you won't sign into Zendesk with Google, you'll sign in with Duo or whatever. So someday next week I might come to work and not be able to do my work. Well, so that was my question that no one has got about yet. They have no access to Zendesk. They cannot do this without being on the phone with me, okay?

**You**: Well. We should just turn off the Google SSO requirement. For now. And become less secure temporarily.

**Other**: In zendesk.

**You**: And preserve the ability to do our jobs. Maybe.

**Other**: We could do that. That's true. Yeah, they can. Again, they don't have access to Zendesk because they didn't want to pay for another account. They have no way to do this without me. It's not going to just magically happen. Okay, that's fine. I trust that's. Enough to assuage my ears for now. Zapier, they want to do this week too. But they have no access to Zapier without asking Justin. So none of this can just happen magically and surprise everybody? The only one that could is the clever developer dashboard, and I don't care. They could shut that off, they can go ahead and break that. They do have an account in there because there was no reason not to just give them one and let them handle it. So those are the three things they claim to be doing in the next week, but they've been saying that for three months. Really hard to take deadlines seriously at areas. And this isn't even Aries. This is their. Paid contractor. It doesn't even meet their deadline. Anyway. Who knows what's happening. And then I also wanted to bring up, like, we all, as of January 1st, we all officially have title changes and whatnot. And at one point there was somebody told me something that I can't remember about how we were supposed to get official email signatures set up with their standards. Does anybody have any further information about that, or should we be doing anything or asking somebody? I don't know. I had the same question. Because I have no idea. Okay? I still use my JumpRope email because same because they didn't take it away. Yeah, and I have been deleting the out of some email. Let me tell I deleted my entire forums. It was like 55,000 emails.

**You**: I have 480,000 emails in my updates.

**Other**: It took it an hour, but it did it.

**You**: Unread.

**Other**: Yeah. You should delete the whole folder. 414,000. It does delete it all at once too. Like you can it chugs away for an hour, but it'll and you you can still use your email while it's doing it, and it eventually will delete everything for you can like say. You can select all in like forums or updates. It will delete it all.

**You**: Yeah, it's remarkable. You have to select all. And then there's the thing that says actually select all. Like beyond this page.

**Other**: Yeah, but it's easy. And then you can just delete it all. I would. Because if they do, if we do want them to migrate it over, it'll be a lot cleaner if all that stuff doesn't come. To. Okay, well, I guess I'm just going to. Copy someone else's email signature for what it's supposed to look like and make my own until it's wrong. My email signature. Okay. Do you have one in outlook? I don't think so. I don't. I don't either. I thought they were going to do that for us. I thought so, too. And I thought we had to have something in our. JumpRope. One explaining that we'd now be using Aries or something, I don't know. On that was not to do that because we didn't want people to get a bunch of bounce, you know, looking emails that look like it had bounced when an auto replies when we were actually receiving their email. It doesn't matter if people keep emailing our JumpRope email for the next. Forever, probably. I just want to get to the point where I'm not having to go back to Gmail to respond. That's the pain in the butt. Right now I have everything coming into outlook. That's easy. But I don't respond in outlook. I can respond. But then it's coming from the Becky b. @aries.com and not everybody might understand that's never going to change, even when they do what they said they were going to do. I thought they were going to give us something, though, to say when we started that. I think we should say something, but I don't think they're going to do it. Yeah, because right now I just read the email and Outlook and then I'm like, okay, this is. This came to. JumpRope. I go back and start responding from Outlook and get people used to it because that's what's. I think that's what's going to happen. I don't think they're going to do anything fancy for us. So if your emails are already forwarding. I think. You should just start telling people, hey, I got a new email address. I would be shocked if they ever actually told us what we're supposed to say. In case you're wondering, you can go into the settings in Outlook and go to Mail and customize actions, and you can put an Archive button on the actual. Thing, like you can customize your buttons, which is super cool. Yeah, I saw that. Oh, an outlet. I did not. Know that. I was like. I was so mad that there's no archive button. Yeah, and you can put it right in line with the email. Too. There's too many options so that such that it doesn't work at all unless you go in and screw with all your options. I don't know. Do you think, Justin, that we should ask for guidance on any of the signatures or on any handling this since they haven't done what they said they're going to do? Or should we just. No. Okay, cool. I kind of done doing that? Not looking for trouble anymore. Fair enough.

**You**: Put it in your self reflection.

**Other**: Yeah. You mean my feedback? That I never did.

**You**: Yeah, I'm on the same point as Justin. Justin raised more, made trouble more than me from day one. But I think that.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: One of the new realities is that that is not our concern anymore until somebody tells us this is.

**Other**: Tells us it is. I am.

**You**: A gift. It's a gift.

**Other**: Yep, I am 100% fine with that. I just feel like as a less senior person than you guys have to see why a little bit that at least I asked you.

**You**: I get it. Yep.

**Other**: I agree with that. To do anything. Great.

**You**: I will tell you. You don't have to do anything anytime you want me to.

**Other**: But you're not in charge of me in any way. I think Justin might be a little bit.

**You**: Great.

**Other**: Yeah, I have a dotted line to all of you.

**You**: I also would rather not. Yes.

**Other**: I don't even see in the mail where you can set up a signature. I found it. I did, too. I don't remember where, but you definitely can. Find account signatures. You can have signatures. Yeah. I don't know why I don't even have my one that sends to you guys. Has appropriate jokes in it. Like I assume we're supposed to have. To look at somebody else's. I. I think you could probably reach out to the IT people for help with the email signature. And not make any waves or. Start a whole thing of people having meetings about it. And they would just give you so that you can put the logo and the whatever, if you wanted. But I thought they wanted us to have a JumpRope or an Aries company or. You know what I mean, like. Yep. And they never came up with what they wanted that to look like. So I'm just going to keep using my JumpRope. Email. All right. Moving on to our actual product. We were hoping to get a release out this week with. Angular upgrade stuff. I did a fairly thorough round of manual qa, Jesse. You saw my list, I assume? My email. Any updates?

**You**: I believe they're all resolved on upper lease.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: If you want to recheck them, go ahead.

**Other**: None of them were super important.

**You**: That. Important. You should look at the view. Standard details on production, it's ten times worse.

**Other**: I know. Well. And I almost filed a bug for it, and then I was like, let me check an app release, and maybe it's fixed and it is. Yeah.

**You**: It accidentally fixed it.

**Other**: That happened a few weeks ago, and I just was, like, debating whether it was worth filing a bug.

**You**: Yeah, it somehow lost its styles and stuff, but I don't think many people use that. But that was a good find.

**Other**: And it was still totally usable, just ugly. And, yeah, nothing that I found. In qa made anything unusable.

**You**: Yeah, I'm feeling pretty confident about it. Right now.

**Other**: I feel.

**You**: I'm fighting with two tests that aren't actual bugs. But I want to get a clean bill of health, so I'm planning to release it tomorrow.

**Other**: Okay? Yeah, I feel good about it. And I clicked through all three versions, top to bottom. The only thing I did not do was the super admin. But if something's ugly in the super admin, like, we can just.

**You**: Yeah, that's not a def. That's not a defect. Escape.

**Other**: Live with it. Right. It's not. It's not a real product. If I have time, I might, but I think I'm going to focus on the technical requirements.

**You**: Yeah, I got my half.

**Other**: For the product integration because I am hell bent on getting that done by the end of this week.

**You**: Yes, I agree.

**Other**: So that's your update, justin. You'll have a trd by Friday. In case you need.

**You**: However, we will need to combine Aries TRD for their parts into ours before it is a final trd and I have no idea what the timeline is.

**Other**: That's true. I'll ask Alicia. That seems like her problem.

**You**: I believe it's. For what it's worth, though, we're going to be working with Nguyen and not Caleb for this round. Which is fine. He seems great.

**Other**: He seems great. Yeah.

**You**: I actually think he's the fastest of them all. Replying and stuff.

**Other**: Yes, that has been my experience. From the little I have seen.

**You**: So jenny is the ba and nguyen is our developer.

**Other**: And what is the ba do? Kind of like what I do.

**You**: I guess what you do. I don't fuck. Ing know. I think they write up the stories or whatever.

**Other**: Yeah. They analyze the business? Sure. At some point, I heard something about how the reason I got the title I got is because they wanted to change from having bas, having product owners. And that was their long term plan.

**You**: Well, and I was introduced to somebody in one of those calls last week. Somebody introduced themselves as the product owner. Of something.

**Other**: Who was it?

**You**: I don't know. A woman.

**Other**: Okay, so there we're in process of doing something like that.

**You**: I don't.

**Other**: Was it melissa?

**You**: Know.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: Maybe.

**Other**: Yeah, I think that they, like, they told me they didn't have any product owners, like, as in that's what HR told me, because I asked like, is this a new position for the company? And they said they didn't have any. But I have seen people with that in.

**You**: Pretty soon they won't have any VPs either.

**Other**: Yeah. Poor developers, so.

**You**: Or developers.

**Other**: Are there more developers quitting? I don't know.

**You**: There's rumors right now. Just.

**Other**: All right. Cool. Do we need anything from anybody else or whatever? With the Angular upgrade and the release this week, I don't think there's anything in this release except for like Hotfix that already went out beyond.

**You**: Correct? Yeah. There's no meaningful. This should be nothing to do if we're looking.

**Other**: There's nothing to run down. It didn't look like a rundown. Yeah. Because the hot fix is already out. And there was just. There was nothing else to talk about. Okay?

**You**: I'm still trying to figure out why the Roster thing is all young people out, but this release is my next attempt at fixing that. The workaround is you can do one roster per login session.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: You probably shouldn't need to print your roster a million times. So hopefully that's okay.

**Other**: The problem is it's admins going through and printing it for people. At least that was most of the complaints I saw. It's like we have three subs today. I need to print this for three. Print each sub their rosters.

**You**: Totally.

**Other**: Yeah. Okay, cool. I forgot about that.

**You**: I mean, I'm trying to fix it. I don't know what the fuck's going on. It only happens when it's deployed to production, so it's been tricky to debug.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Sweet. Haley, you asked for access to the agenda. Do you need to add something?

**You**: It also doesn't give me access to the agenda. Anymore.

**Other**: Yeah. Apparently you have to give access every week separately.

**You**: Sw. Eet.

**Other**: Can we please? Haven't we paid for fellows for like July? So many things to have fellow back. Well, we still have it. Let's just. Can we figure out how to integrate it? Can we just use Google Meet until they. What are we doing on teams? Well, we weren't supposed to have Google Meet anymore. I know, but we do, and nobody said a damn thing. About it going anywhere. They can't even figure out how to change our sso. To stop relying on Google. So I don't. I don't. Like we might as well just use the stuff that works until they take it away. I don't know. I don't care, but. Fellows paid through July. Something like that. Might as well use it, because this sucks. Let me see if I can get it. Integrated into teams.

**You**: You'll get blocked by if I click the open in a new window in the agenda. It works. Just doesn't load.

**Other**: Oh, really? Oh, mine. Working in the sidebar now.

**You**: Yeah, mine is now, too. Maybe somebody approved me.

**Other**: Yeah. I don't know, haley. Only I see it. Interesting. It's probably not that bad once we get used to it. I just. Don't want to. Kind of like Trello. I. I want to keep Trello, damn it.

**You**: You can use Trello for free.

**Other**: Yeah. I think you can only have five boards or something, which is fine. I can consolidate.

**You**: You can make five boards work.

**Other**: Yeah, I absolutely can. I just. I need to know what's going to get deleted or whatever if we cancel it. I don't know. I need to. Jb. Oh, Jesse, speaking of interviews. If Jason's not here, might that. Directive be updated. Like. Might you be able to make an argument for something else a little bit more? You know, like, he was hell bent on the Offshore people, but new guy might not be.

**You**: So I guess I'm here to ask for Yalls thoughts. I have been given. Six resumes and I've conducted two interviews of offshore developers who are based in India. There's a budget going before the board. Next week. For approval. And currently the budget requests funding for two full time remote developers who will work under me. I. 'm either upset nor excited about that. I think the people I've met with seem perfectly competent. They have. Approximately 12 minutes of overlapping time of their days, which is perfect because I do not want print on meetings with developers ever.

**Other**: Right? So you have to figure out how to do it.

**You**: And we will not be doing standups. We will not be doing real time work much at all. So that's actually fine. What I'm considering going to probably through Andrea at this point instead of Jason about this is to say either. Based on my workload, I'm nervous. The timing here is bad. It'll slow me down too much before I can gain from it. Or a compromise of. I might hire one. And not both. And give me a big old AI budget because I can blow through $100 a day and AI credits being productive. If I pull out the stops. Anyway. I'm pretty indifferent about it. I think I'd make whatever work. I don't think anything will work. So I can make any of them work.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: For the long term. As in, I still don't see a path to removing myself as the old single point of failure through hiring remote developers.

**Other**: Offshore people. Offshore people. I think you should make the point that offshore developers are not going to improve that for them.

**You**: Yeah. So I have. I've made that point to Jason, to Brent and to Andrea at this point, but not strongly. More like, by the way, this isn't necessarily the way to build capacity.

**Other**: Strongly. Sure. Okay? Yeah. That does not solve your problem. No.

**You**: So, anyway, I just wanted. What would these people do? Fix bugs. Dive into weird security issues that I hate reading about.

**Other**: Like I'll get more to do.

**You**: Cleanup tests.

**Other**: They're going to be worse at bug fixing than Claude.

**You**: Yeah, probably. They're going to be needier.

**Other**: They're going to be much needier and they're going to be slower and they're going to have a ton of questions that take three days to answer instead of 30 seconds, because at the time differences.

**You**: Yeah. That's the thing.

**Other**: They're not going to be fast enough about bug fixing.

**You**: Right.

**Other**: I don't think.

**You**: But for who? Are we doing this for me? Are we doing this for Aries?

**Other**: I mean, maybe eventually, yeah. Right.

**You**: We're doing this for JumpRope legacy.

**Other**: Yeah. I don't.

**You**: Doing it for our customers. I don't. Know. Some. Thoughts.

**Other**: Yeah. I don't know. Like, I. I just. Such an uncharted territory that it's hard for me to picture. I still think. I'd rather have Nathan back than two Offshore guys. Talk to a human.

**You**: Interesting idea. I'm trying to sort out how much they. I'm trying to sort out how much they actually cost because Nathan, even they're at least going to be. He'd be twice as much as them, at least.

**Other**: I think it's a great idea. Would be 20. Twice as much. But we don't. But. But he comes in with some knowledge, and maybe we only need one.

**You**: And guess what? I also don't have to have meetings with him.

**Other**: Correct.

**You**: Or talk anyway. Yeah. So the idea for the rest of you is that Nathan might actually work out better in this environment, and we don't have the same kind of resource constraints or. And there's a lot more structure around what he would do.

**Other**: Like. Right. Right.

**You**: Out of the box. Kind of.

**Other**: And I think, like, he could be at least a partial, a step towards a solution of the single point of failure thing. Whereas I just don't see an offshore developer being that because I don't see them ever having loyalty, you know, or. Any reason to stick around or truly learn about our product or.

**You**: I will say, in my sense of the offshore developers, their experience is with companies Aries size or bigger.

**Other**: Bigger. Yeah.

**You**: That's who hires these firms that are. Global Logic has tens of thousands and EPAM is another tens of thousands of developers in their pool. And these are just JPMorgan Chase grabs a thousand of them for a project for two years or something like crazy like that. And what that means is. They're going to be asking us a lot of questions about our bugs. As they exist today.

**Other**: Well, and I was going to say. And then there's going to be turnover. And the next. Right, like, we'll have question.

**You**: Right.

**Other**: You're. Yeah. Like, you're not ever going to get any, like, purchased, right? Like, kind of. Like, as in. Hold on it. I don't know. Right. That's interesting. Yeah, sure. Nathan's not, like, teaching surfing lessons in Costa Rica. Retired. Too many kids. For that. Yeah. What are the chances that he.

**You**: Yeah, we got in touch with him in the acquisition. So he's still in Missouri?

**Other**: That's right. For the chances that he keeps his. LinkedIn up to date and we could. Stalk him. I found him. Does he have his ponytail in the picture? No. Doesn't say where he works right now. Oh, wait, yeah, it does. Reinsurance group of america. Sounds terrible. Truly. He wants a new job.

**You**: Yeah. Come to Aries. It's less terrible.

**Other**: Be way better. It might not be that bad. He's only worked at his current place for a couple of years, so he can't be.

**You**: At least he'd have us.

**Other**: Right. At least he'd have us. And.

**You**: Okay, well, I'm gonna noodle on it a little warmer.

**Other**: Looks like he might be doing contract. I don't know. That was in the past. So he did contract work for this reinsurance group, and then he worked at somewhere called Presence Learning, and then he.

**You**: I was thinking of starting an offshore development group. Stuffed with an army of clods and contracting it out to Aries.

**Other**: Wanted to be a near shore.

**You**: Yeah. It's just on a barge floating off the coast of Florida.

**Other**: He's like a no shore. He's in Missouri. Sort of.

**You**: You can get so far with Starlink. You put the whole data center crunch in the AI under the waterline for cooling.

**Other**: Oh, that's an idea. You got to deal with the salt, though, right?

**You**: Well. Yeah.

**Other**: This corrosion to the.

**You**: I was thinking that just the surface of that side would bleed off.

**Other**: Be enough.

**You**: But instead of pumping, I don't know. So maybe off Greenland. That'll be on short.

**Other**: There you go. That's a dangerous place to be at all.

**You**: Contribute to the ice sheet smell thing by putting a data center. In the ice sheet. Okay, I'll think about it a little more. Just wanted to see if anybody. Had poignant thoughts. I'm working with Haley to resurrect Jumpbot. You've seen some signs of life. He's not yet on his feet. I was dusting off an older version and trying to bring it closer to my current vision. But Haley. I gave Haley. Kind of a sketch of. Prd if you will. Brd I don't know. One of the d's.

**Other**: You do?

**You**: We will. Probably where we landed. Last week. Is we're not going to do a fancy chat. In the sidebar on desk. For this round, it's going to interact through private comments on tickets. So it'll trigger when new tickets come in. It will gather context. Look for. Help Docs related tickets. Other things it can figure out which will get smarter over time. In theory, it can examine settings. Figure out what version the edition they're on, what features are enabled. Because it can get so far as examining. Like bra settings, things like that in our database. It's not doing it yet. Anyway, and it will post a ticket analysis to every incoming ticket as a private comment. A couple few minutes after a ticket comes in. Haley that will often include a suggested reply. That will probably not be right. But you can copy, paste and edit it. And you can mention a private comment and it will read your comment along with the whole ticket up to that point. And respond. And kind of the killer feature, which is something I only recently gained. The ability to do is you can give it feedback and it will self improve. So if you say jb, that reply was pretty good. But you forgot to look at blah, blah, blah. It's going to reanalyze that ticket, suggest a new reply or whatever, but it's also going to go back to its resources and kind of its prompt, if you will. And potentially update its prompt. And I'm going to keep it changed while I'll go to all those prompt updates because one of the go ahead.

**Other**: Okay. And will that? I was going to say, will that change log, you're probably going to say be in part of the internal. Like, is that something I can see? Would that be visible to me or would it be useful? I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I think it would. Especially now. Yeah.

**You**: Yeah, but. I would like you to be able to see it. Yes. I think so. Yeah, I'll figure out a way to publish it to you. You might have to log into GitHub or something to see it, but that's pretty easy account to make.

**Other**: Okay? O. Kay.

**You**: If you have thoughts and questions like that. Add them to the bottom of that file or I guess, gosh.

**Other**: Okay? Can I comment on that task or something?

**You**: Just want to make.

**Other**: You want to. Okay.

**You**: I have no idea. Can you? I don't know.

**Other**: No. I mean, I can't. I am able to. Would that go to on the juror card? Okay.

**You**: Sure. The jira card? Yeah. That's a great place for the feedback. Just put add comments to the J card. That's perfect.

**Other**: Sure. And if I. I don't. What do I want to say? That's not going to tag it in Zendesk, right? Like, but that is a. Way that I can.

**You**: So at JB is not a person in Zendesk. It'll just be text. It is reading every. It gets triggered every time there's any update to a ticket.

**Other**: Like. Communicate with. Yeah, yeah. But that is. Okay?

**You**: And it just only does something. If it's a new ticket or there's an adjudge and we can refine that.

**Other**: Great. Okay? I saw it was getting triggered, and I was like, well, how can I talk back to it? Maybe not yet, but. Okay, cool. At jub that works.

**You**: Well, it is not yet healthy today. I'm Frankensteining it back to life at the moment.

**Other**: Yes. Yeah, I understand that. Yeah.

**You**: So I'm doing that.

**Other**: Can I do things like that? Are you okay with me just poking around or no?

**You**: Sure. I just am not ready to. I am okay with you poking around. I don't think it will work very often yet.

**Other**: Okay? That's fine. And I'm not going to come to you and be like it's misspelled the word carrots. No. Don't worry. I just am curious, so.

**You**: I think by next week I can be like, yeah, I'm 95% sure. It will actually reply to tickets right now. I'm doing plumbing right now.

**Other**: Okay? Cool. All right. I can. I can hold off, too. I just don't want to get so far behind what questions you are going to ask me. That I have to play catch up there, so I'm just going to kind of follow. Follow along a little bit more.

**You**: Totally. Yeah. Play all you want. And the JIRA card. Let's just keep everything there and comments on the jump card until further notice.

**Other**: Okay? Okay? Cool. And you know what? Team. S doesn't have, like, for me, the odd echo when nobody's talking. I get, like. In Google Meet, I kind of get a little bit of feedback. That people are actually still here. That's weird. It really filters out, like your breathing. Maybe feel like I hear anything either, but really, like when nobody is talking this call especially like it feels like nothing. Like I can't even hear people shuffling around. And I used to. Anyways. I had something. It's a different topic. It's shifting. Are you ready? Go for it. Okay. So I'm just on a. You know, temperature finding mission here. So this. Is. No's are fine. I just need to say that I asked somebody else. And they also gave it. So this is for Kent isd. They're in Michigan school. 22, 2200 students. Jenna, you've seen some of the specs for their custom calculation. Oh, is it that this. It's a mode calculation. And then I actually should say this is a custom grade conversion is actually where. But what they want is. A logic based. If this many pass this threshold and there's this many total given a kind of thing for their course grade, this is in addition to a custom calculation, right? Well, yeah. So the custom calculation, yes. Yes, they are okay with our so they use mode and are out of the box mode. Is fine for them right now, but they would potentially like to have something custom to that. They're a trial right now. They're a trial right now. They are willing to. They want to know is there. You know, like they'll pay more. If. But they are also, you know, they want to make the trial. As real as possible. Right. They can make a decision.

**You**: So let's step back and let's think about this in our new environment as a high level.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: Thing, right?

**Other**: Yeah, yeah.

**You**: So I think we all have our reactions to what we would have done a year ago if this came onto our plate. What's different today? Number one is. What constitutes an exciting customer to Aries might be different than what makes exciting customer to us. To is their appetite for professional services revenue. Maybe different than ours. In terms of.

**Other**: That might be changing with Jennifer out.

**You**: Totally. Yeah, we don't know. That's part of my point here. And then a third thing that I see is different. Well, I guess what I would say is. It in our theory that. In the best possible outcomes of the next few years. That leaning into. Things like custom calculations and. Conversions is still as relevant as it would have been. Thinking about the next five years of JumpRope. Pre aries. So I just want to talk about that level for a minute because I don't want to make the decision the way we used to. If there's a better way to make it, and it might be that we need to ask questions. I will say, if we don't deal with this in this group, It'll be months before we have an answer. Probably. Unless they say, I don't know enough, do what you would have always done. Which would be the right answer for them to say. But I don't know if we get to say that for them. So can we make a custom conversion based on these specs? I haven't read it. But most likely. With some little back and forth. Ironing anything out that they didn't think of. We most likely could.

**Other**: Yeah. I mean, all of. Yeah, all of what you said is what I expected to hear, Jesse. And already, you know. Have kind of said as much, but in a soft way to the customer. Like. You know?

**You**: My inclination is, it's still something we're good at, even though we don't love doing it. Most people can't do this. And. I still want JumpRope to be a good product for people. And. I want. Them to be able to access its value.

**Other**: Yeah. Definitely want to see growth outside of just California and New York City. I mean, I think I don't. Again, I don't know if this will change, but there was definitely a huge focus on hybrid New York City and California. And so it would be nice to see revenue growing in other places to justify. The investment there. And I think Michigan is a place that could be a big growth opportunity. Agreed. I think. I think it's a good. A good customer to invest in. Of course, I also think we have to be mindful of making sure they have a good experience. My concern with the counting things is always the what do you do when you have five standards assessed in your class? It's like it's one thing to give a semester, but if you're. If you have a counting based calculation, That's not something you can apply ongoing, which I'm fine with. They just need to be aware of the fact that they, you know, they need to be mindful of what they're doing and their mastery schemes. Yeah, like what? And what do they want it to. We need to know what they want it to display when there's not enough information. To calculate a grade. Like, is it a U until? Or, you know, is it nothing? No conversion until then. And then is that going to confuse them because it's blank? So those are always my just general concerns.

**You**: And then.

**Other**: But yeah.

**You**: Is it philosophically sound, Haley? Does it make any damn sense? Your opinion.

**Other**: It's converting to letter grades, so, yeah. Philosophically irrelevant. Yeah, yeah. I think that a lot of their motivation to kind of push back on this, at least today, was that grounded in. Practice necessarily, or best practice, but more grounded. In consistency across what they've been doing.

**You**: Practicality.

**Other**: Practicality. We've already made so many changes. Can. Can't we just keep this. Kind of thing, like they're doing it hodgepodge in their. Whatever system they're using now. And so. I think their motivation is like, man, we want to make this easier. But I also recognize that even building so JumpRope does the magic, if you will, is not going to make it easier. It just makes the pain in a different direction, you know, like. I don't know. They're not going to get the solution that they. Hold on to say. A. No to this particular group. Does not feel. Terrible to me on the scale of this. They use mode and don't have a grade conversion this year. Right? Yeah. So here's the thing. Is there, like, a. I think no grade conversion? No. Course grade conversion is a lot easier sell for me to do. With them. But the mode specifications might be something that I would. Like us to explore further. And I, but I don't. I'm always more hesitant with custom calculations than port grade conversions, you know, like. Billy, how much of this is complicated by the fact that they're a Tech center with 16 contributing schools?

**You**: Oh, God.

**Other**: That they have to present 22 schools. Yes. That was something that, you know, we have 2,000 students and, yeah, maybe 16 schools. So they have to be pump out something recognizable across 16 sending receiving schools. I think that's part of the complication that is. And they don't want to move the cheese now because they have this messaging out already and people been working within those parameters.

**You**: When do they need it? B.

**Other**: Yesterday? I don't know. No, I'm kidding. They are, you know, their teachers are slowly trialing. I'm having a second meeting with teachers next week. There's six or something, five teachers that are using JumpRope and.

**You**: Where can I glance at specs?

**Other**: You know?

**You**: Tick. Et number or something.

**Other**: Yeah. Let me grab it. Hold on. I would put the ticket in slack. Can I use slack? Remember how they really didn't want to keep all this going because they really didn't want to do the work to be it for us to be allowed to use any of it. And then we said, fine, and then they never did. Their. About flag. About any of the software that we use. They wanted it all gone because they didn't have to vet it for security. So I did. I just put. I put the ticket in slack. Jesse. I can put it elsewhere. Too.

**You**: Right now.

**Other**: Okay? In the very first comment in that thread. It says. Please click here to find our edge cases.

**You**: Second most frequent score. Most frequent score.

**Other**: So let me tell you. So they refer to core skills, our parent standards. And. Focus areas are child standards. In that document that you're looking at. They. Have asked about a mode on parent standards, and I told them that's a no. Like no custom calculation for parents standards. Yeah.

**You**: And then the semester letter grade.

**Other**: It's based on some.

**You**: A proficiency level on proficient or advanced in each skill. So I would interpret that as every single standard that has a non zero weight underneath this course. Is. In proficient or advanced. That looks pretty simple.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And then the bimodal situation.

**Other**: There's some scenarios where what they would like in a tie is to round it is to choose the lower value. And I was unsure how our out of the box mode.

**You**: Got it. R's average is a tie.

**Other**: That's what I thought. Okay.

**You**: Or at least that's what I remember doing long time ago.

**Other**: That's what I remember, but I haven't, like, booked, so.

**You**: I'll do it if it shows up in Jira.

**Other**: And by it. Do you think?

**You**: Either or both.

**Other**: The okay. And the other thing that's changed a bit about these verses a few years ago is like, How much of it AI can kind of help with. You know, I don't think it takes as long anymore. Or at least it hasn't for me in fixing them.

**You**: Yeah, we'll find out.

**Other**: Yeah. Okay? So it's more. I think it's more important to think through. Is this going to be a good experience for the customer? That's fine than our time and whether we can do it. Yeah. Because that answer is pretty much always. Yes. Well, I understand it's a good idea. Tell me? Yes. Because it's not always yes. It's not always yes, pretty much. Pretty much always possible. That's the problem with how Olsen's like to say things. So. I guess not a problem. But just the detail.

**You**: That was orange, Haley.

**Other**: Was it? I don't feel like it also does a protected character. I am. I think it's probably a target, actually. Now, that might have been orange, okay?

**You**: I have a problem with how you like to hear things.

**Other**: Yeah, yeah. I can just mute you and then I don't have to hear you.

**You**: Cameras, man. Underdogs.

**Other**: Yeah. Candor knocks is what we go by. Yes. The tander dogs. It's actually gotten out their official some we get junk mail to the tander dogs and I'm like, that is amazing. That is some made up.

**You**: Amazing.

**Other**: Where? Yeah. My concern for these guys is just support in the mid and long term. Of this and what it like? How do we translate what? How do we notate and keep record of what? Is being done. You know, so somebody, a support person that Aries can be like, oh, yeah, I see that you have this custom piece. That's a whole thing. That's already a problem. That's already a problem. And I'm just like, you know, what's the cost? I mean, what's the opportunity cost of, you know? Contributing to that with the balance. On potentially winning this important, potentially important strategic customer. Versus managing all that? I don't know.

**You**: Back when I had ownership in the outcome, I would have said, yep, we should take. Because that could get momentum.

**Other**: And it's a good site and a good.

**You**: If it does, we'll follow through.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah, might feel that way. You know, I do have. I have the designs for the product that would solve this problem.

**You**: I just think somebody.

**Other**: Maybe if we had some more engineer resources, we could build it.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: That's true. There you go. Okay? Well, I'm going. Here's what I would like to do. I think I'm going to think on this. I'm going to tell them we might have a little bit of movement. I'm going to try and. Share this document and the places where Jenna has already given some notes about things that are definitely no's or that sort. And I will try and do a jira situation for it. Does that sound? Okay, right up. A jar card.

**You**: Do they have enough data right now? That you. Would, in theory, next week, be able to show them a meaningful working product.

**Other**: No. No.

**You**: So that also means that it's hard for me to test. Kind of as in, I mean, I can make a fake class with fake stuff, but it's got to be kind of in their environment to fully test it.

**Other**: No. So for timeline, go ahead. Sure. I can push them getting a little bit more data and to JumpRope. But I think probably that cell or that push would be next week. I meet with their teachers next week, so I don't. Is that like. Starting to look at this, Jesse, from your perspective after, like, a week from today, is that okay? Like I don't think I need you before then. On. This? Yeah.

**You**: Yeah, it's fine.

**Other**: Okay? O. Kay. Cool. Thank you. Alrighty. I'm good on that one. On that front now, thank you. Meeting adjourned. Quick. Hey, guess what happened to the IPS team.

**You**: What's an ips?

**Other**: Everybody. That is. Thank you. Implementation and professional services. It's like ibmp, but better.

**You**: What happen? Ed.

**Other**: Just to, like, give you guys a little bit of, like. Okay. We share in this, apparently. The zoom. Subscription was significantly reduced. And so the IPS team when they they've been relying on Zoom AI note taker. And that was like. Removed from what they were able to use as of, like, January 1st, and nobody knew it until it didn't work. Oh my God. And so they. And then their teams subscription for that group of people is not high enough. Not like enterprise level customer communication. You mean what they use for customer communication? So they relied on zoom and AI note taking, and that was taken away from them because the subscription was reduced. Without their knowledge. And then their team subscription is not. A high enough tier to have the AI node transcriber. So Director has to make a formal request. Yeah, right. They direct us to make a formal request to ask that their teams or our team subscription is high enough to get AI. There you go.

**You**: So they have to pay attention to meetings again. So this is a glimpse of the future. Right now is what's going to happen is we'll build dependencies.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: The gatekeepers will jack up the price.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: And then we'll be left. Having forgotten how to have meetings.

**Other**: That too. Well, or just whatever it is.

**You**: Or take notes in the right code or write custom conversions.

**Other**: Yeah. What I don't understand is this, like, massive AI push and then all this gatekeeping around, AI spending. I know. Right. Like. I just. I don't quite understand. The thinking around that. No. It's like we don't pay for it until somebody complains.

**You**: It's because the only push that's actually happening is shareholder value, and they see AI is increasing that.

**Other**: With a good enough excuse.

**You**: And they see lowering spending is increasing that.

**Other**: There you go. Yeehaw.

**You**: 's true. Of most companies.

**Other**: Well. Becky. Anything else interesting happen at the sco? No, I was really just invited to be that bookend their lunch. That was it. They're still chugging along, apparently. All right. Shrugging along. Everyone just see the new job opportunity email that we got from hr. We just got an email. For a business analyst position. Came on came while we were in this meeting. So we're hiring. An internal job opening.

**You**: Hey.

**Other**: Yeah, internal.

**You**: Maybe I finally can figure out what a business analyst does.

**Other**: Yeah. Super. Probably heard me said that, and he said he's going to apply for it. Probably get it.

**You**: Tell them to run away.

**Other**: Yeah. Did someone leave? Someone Retired, I think. I think I was retired. That's right, Sylvia.

**You**: Yeah. Sylvia ty, retired.

**Other**: Says you or someone you know. So it's not internal, like. Has to be hiring from. Should I. Should I apply for it?

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: You should. I might apply. What's the salary? Right.

**You**: I think most of us are qualified. Becky might struggle with the technical requirements part a little bit.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: That was orange. Sorry.

**Other**: That is yellow or orange, I don't know. Calling you out. I learned that we can call you out, but only if we're in, like, the staff lunchroom. Conversation.

**You**: Yes. Correct. Becky went to school for words.

**Other**: Right.

**You**: Right? Not numbers and stuff.

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty sure most of the time. Becky does have a degree in education technology from Harvard, so I think that probably makes qualified. I don't know how people on the west coast feel about Harvard. But pretty sure it's a worse job than she has now. I don't know. I don't know yet. I don't know what you mean by worse. Yeah.

**You**: Actually sounds a lot like your job, Jenna.

**Other**: Sounds worse. Yeah, except. I don't think my job is to find out what customers want. I think that's Justin's job. Serve as product owner to specific product teams. Jess? Yeah, it's like a product owner. Plus some things I think, maybe. I don't really know. That's why they said they were going to stop having business analysts, but then that maybe that was Jason's thing. Slash. It's going to be a whole project to do. Meantime, might as well hire. What's gerkin. User story. Software.

**You**: Never heard of. It. Probably figure it out.

**Other**: No. Salary range 72 to 100,000. That's what it says. Ability to adapt to sudden changes in project requirements and priorities. What do you mean? Can you imagine that happening? Well, y'all, as much as I enjoy. Hanging out with you. See ya. Got a lot of to do this week.
