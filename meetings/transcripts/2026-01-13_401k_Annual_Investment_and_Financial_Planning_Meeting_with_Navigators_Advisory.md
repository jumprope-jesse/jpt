## Transcript

**Other**: I'm Ben Julia now and my partner, Jasmine Bush, and we are, as Nika said, representing Navigators Advisory, and we are the plan advisor for the 401. If you want to think of the 401k as a stool and there's three legs to the that you'd want to know. One is the record keeper. And so the record keeper was Transamerica. And now it's in power. So Empowers the place where the money is. Captain Empower works with the payroll company to make contributions to your account, whether it's pre tax or post tax or employer or your own. And so they are the record keeper and then another leg of the stool is the third party administrator. This is cross plans, not that you need to know, it's more of a behind the scenes player. But they are helping with tax reporting and ERISA requirements and compliance. And then we are the other leg of the stool and we are doing the advisory work and reviewing the investment funds to make sure they're doing their job. And when there's on the current menu and they're they're not doing a good job and we can replace them, whether for performance or for cost or sometimes both. And it improves your participant outcomes. We do that. Also, we are point of contact when you may have financial planning questions, whether it's hey, where can I get a cool budgeting tool? Or how should I be invested in my 401k? I want to retire in 5 years. Am I close? And so any of those questions and conversations, we're happy to be a resource and also point you in the right direction of other really cool tools that are out there that you would want to use. And there's many free tools out there. And so that's part of our job to continue to be up and current on those things that are out there that can improve your participant outcomes and help you, and so we're happy to be a resource for you. And then also, as Nika said, this is an annual meeting that we like to have where some of the items will be review, but then some of the items will also be new. And so I'll let Jasmine take it away. Everyone. Yes, my name is Jasmine Bush, so I will give you guys my contact info at the end, but I will be someone that you can reach out to if you're not really sure where to go. Some things are pretty straightforward on the Empower website, but there are things that can get a little complicated and you can always shoot me an email or give me a call, and I can either directly help you out, point you in the right direction. But yeah, that's. That's what we do here, that's what Aries has hired us to do, is to really help you guys in with the 401k, but. Also in other aspects of your financial health. So the first slide. Is really just how to access the account or enroll. So you can either do it with your employee login. I put it here. You really could just google just like Empower or log in for 1K and it'll pop up. But its participant Empower Retirement dot com. But again, if you shoot that into Google, just like Employee Login 401k, you'll get that. And if you have an account, you'll you'll just enter your credentials. If you need to register, there's just like a little register button. Go ahead and fill out all that info. It will if you are eligible for the plan or if you're enrolled, it will pop up from your info that you input, usually your Social Security number. There is a mobile app. You can go on the mobile app or you can call the phone number if you have any direct questions for them. Or you can do paper forms. So we can provide paper forms for you to enroll in the plan. So the website or the paper forums will also be how you would update your percentages that you're putting in. Or I think the easier way would be the website. But if you really didn't want to do that you could also do the paper forms. And your beneficiaries as well. That's how you'd update those kinds of things and seeing your balance and everything like that. Nika, this is where you interrupt and you say, no paper. No paper. In my head right now, I was like, the website's really easy to register, and that's. Where you're going to make all your changes when you go into, you know, adjust your contributions. But please note, paper. Yeah. I always have to put it as like, there are some people. But I know you guys are a technology company, so it would be a little crazy if you were really into the paper forms, but you know. Highlight. So here is your plan at a glance. So this the provider is in power. This is the plan number. You don't usually need the plan number. It's more for the, for the sponsors. But sometimes they will ask for it. So here it is, 530649. Your plan contact. You're going to contact Nika, that's going to be the first person that you'll go to on your on the airy side. Here's the number again. The types of allowed deferrals. So you are able to put in two different types of monies. So you can either put in pre Tax or Roth. There is a lot of debate on what's better. I have my opinions. I know Ben has his own opinions of what's what's better to do. And the next slide we can kind of we'll break it down for you of why you would want to do either one. But either one is a good. Just putting something away is is the most important thing. Rollovers are accepted. So let's say you have, like, oh, I have, like, you know, an old 401k here in an old 401k there from old companies that I used to work at. This plan will accept that money. So if you want to just consolidate, make everything easier for yourself, you can have it all here at Empower under the Aries bracket.

**You**: Hello. Yes. Tomorrow. 4:30, right? Five. Feet. We will be there. No, we're good.

**Other**: If you're putting in 5%, you'll get 4%. If you put in 4%, you'll get 3 and a half percent. If you put a 3%, you'll get 3%. So that is how that works. You are eligible after one month of employment. And your entry date is the first day of the month immediately following your eligibility date. So let's say you're eligible on, you know, January 13th. The next time that or the the day that you can enroll in the plan is February 1st. So it's just the first day of the month immediately following your eligibility date. And our next slide, I'm going to kick it to Ben, but it's going to be more of, like, what would be. What would be the pre Tax and the Roth. Like, what would be better for you and why you would pick one? Awesome. Thanks, jasmine. So the plan has two options for your personal contributions and one is that you can take tax deduction to make from your income to make a contribution. That's the pre tax. The second is where you can pay the tax on your income now and make what's called a Roth 401k contribution. So let's walk through some components of the difference between the two. So, pre tax, there are contributions that reduce your taxable income today. The taxes will be paid when the money is withdrawn. In the future, you cannot withdraw the money from the 401k until you're 59 and a half. That's when you become eligible and where there would not be a 10% penalty. Now I will say there are hardship provisions where if you have a hardship, you can make a withdrawal without penalty. But the IRS is not a charity. And so they are in this to get their cut of what they you're entitled to. So when you take the money out, if you make a pre tax contribution, Whether now or in the future. You will pay income taxes on the pre tax side. So the third bullet is. Generally best to do a pre tax contribution if you expect yourself to be in a lower tax bracket when you retire. Now, you know, show of hands, who knows for sure what tax bracket they're going to be in when they retire. I know most of you don't have your cameras on, but there shouldn't be any hands because none of us know. We don't know the future of taxes. I think I've mentioned in one of these education meetings before that when Ronald Reagan was an actor, the highest tax bracket was believe it or not. Hopefully you stay in your chair. 91%. 91%. Also, historical tax brackets have been. There's a period of time when it was 73%. Ultimately, we don't know what the future of taxes looks like based on your, your goals and your personal planning. If you wanted to share that with us, we could give you maybe a kind of better, more thought out reason on what best for you. But ultimately all of us are gambling to a degree with hey, should we contribute pre tax or post tax? But I'll say you can do both. The last bullet point on the pre tax is future growth will be subject to taxes. So pivoting now to the Roth just to touch on the future growth, if you pay your tax now and make a Roth contribution. That money then grows tax free. And when you take it out, it's tax free. Some people like to say that you basically disinherit the IRS from your future growth by doing that. But again, tax bracket, when you retire, then a Roth could be something to consider. But if you're sure and very confident, you'll be in a lower tax bracket and you won't need to live on as much income as you're making now than a pre tax is generally the best thing to do. So the four bullet points on Roth contributions are taxed today. Qualified withdrawals are tax free. It's best if you again if you expect a higher tax bracket layer and then also it will lower your take home pay now for future tax free income. So what that means is if you're making that Roth 401k contribution, you will pay the tax on your income. Today. So what you are actually putting into the plan will be an amount that reduces your paycheck. You'll see, you'll see it differently. And so some people don't like that. And so then they default to the pre tax. But again, what is best for you, we don't know unless we were to have a conversation with you. And if you are a very conservative person and you're unsure, maybe it makes sense to do both. I will also mention that for most of you, the employer contributions, I believe for all of you, actually, the employer contributions, which is the safe harbor 4%, that will be a pre tax contribution because take the tax deferral to make that contribution. And so those monies, the employer safe harbor contribution on your behalf when you take those monies out they taxes. So I hope that makes sense. Let's go to the next slide. Okay, this is what we call the financial period. Many of you have seen this before, so you just want to build a solid foundation and then work our way to the top. So when people have $2,000 in their savings account and no money in a 401k and they're telling you that they're going to take their next paycheck and put it all in bitcoin. And that's their financial plan. I hope that's not your financial plan. So we want to build. How do we do that? So one of the first goals we can start with is if you do not have $1,000 in your savings and checking account, but make that your goal for 2026, that you save enough money to have $1,000. Stats show that fees 7% of Americans cannot afford $800 financial disruption or an $800. Said differently, if all your tires need to be replaced and you go to AmericasTires to get four brand new tires on your car, it's possible that could be an $800 expense. Seven percent of Americans couldn't pay that with cash. They had to put that on the credit card and then work on paying it off. So we want you to help move that number down. We want you to be in the stronger financial position by having $1,000. So if you're already there and you're laughing, you're saying, ben, who are you talking about? I don't even know people like that. Okay, good for you. So then we want to move towards getting to three months in cash. And maybe if you're closer to retirement, you want to have six. Months of expenses in cash. What does that mean? If you're spending, I'm going to use around number $5,000 a month on expenses. You'd want to have $30,000 in cash. That would be prepared. So if you get to retirement, you could go a couple of months without a paycheck and still be able to fund your lifestyle. If you get to a point, you have six months of expenses in cash. And you start, you're still having surplus income and cash flow every month. Now you're in a very strong position financially and you can consider doing other things above that foundational risk management block here. Continue on the risk management block. Insurances. I'm sure many of you have various insurances, whether it's home and auto, disability, health and life insurance. You want to make sure to have the appropriate amounts of those. If you have questions on, well, what is the appropriate amount, we'd be happy to help guide you in the right direction, but you want to have insurance protection in place. It's just commonly a good thing to do. Next thing is estate planning. So estate planning is a term that sums up four legal documents. Some of you have probably heard of these legal documents. Will, a trust, a healthcare directive, and a durable power of attorney. If you don't know what estate planning documents you need again will help guide you in the right direction. I'll say definitively, if you own a home and you own real property, you should have a full estate plan with a trust. Because if you don't. Your asset could go through probate, which we've told you before is the lawsuit you file against yourself. And then you lose. So you want to avoid probate at all costs. I'm sure some of you have had experience with your family with probate. It's not fun. Last thing is paying off debt. If you have student loan debt, if you have credit card debt, let's build a plan to knock out that debt. That is really a good component of achieving financial freedom. The average credit card debt is between 20 and 26% is the average interest. That is so that's a high interest rate, so moving on to wealth accumulation. So once you have those risks managed, then the 401k contributions become even more relevant and you start moving from not just getting the employer safe harbor match. Considering how much should you be contributing yourself should you max out the 401 should be saving in other types of accounts like brokerage accounts, or do you want to buy more real estate for rental purposes and then also education savings? What is best for you? So for those of us who live in the state of California, you do not get a tax deduction to make a contribution to a 529 college savings account. Some other states do. But if you have questions about that, again, we could be a resource. Moving on up. So if you're doing those things in the risk management and the wealth accumulation, you're on your way to achieving financial independence. And then if you close to retirement and you say, hey, I'm five years out, three years out, seven years out, I want to know if I'm really for crossing over to retirement. We can run what's called a retirement analysis for you. Now, we don't have. We're not staffed to run a retirement analysis for all couple hundred participants, but for those of you who are five years or closer to retirement, we would be happy to run analysis for you to help you. Understand where you are, what you need to do. That's something that's another tool and resource. Empower also has resources for you online that are free. And then lastly, it's going back to estate planning. But this is the selling your attitude.

**You**: Fisheries.

**Other**: Care about. That is a financial period. I don't know if we have any questions in the chat. Can we roll over on the app, or do we need to contact someone at Empower? You can contact someone in Empower. You can also contact Jasmine from our team. She can help you. I'm not sure if you can do it on the app because there's some nuances to the rollover that you want to make sure you're selecting it correctly, so I generally default to either working with empower to do it or have an US help you do it. And then is that 3% on what we contribute to the 401k? Not based on our base pay, the salary. It is. It is based on. It's based on basement. So if you make $10,000 for the year and you can, that's $300 of your own money and then $300 of company money to total $600. If you contribute 5% to get you contribute $500 of your own money and you get 4. Hundred dollars of company money to total. Great question. Yeah. Is there any assistance with estate planning? Through you guys or empower. So Empower doesn't have tools to help with estate planning. We can help you with estate planning. We are not attorney. We'll draft the document for you, but we will help you identify what you need and sometimes so we'll certainly do that also. Sometimes we can just guide you to and you'll see, it's a resource at the bottom of the presentation. It's called trust in will, and it's the most economical way to get legal documents created. However, sometimes that is not the most, not the best option because there could be some different details of your estate planning that you need drafted correctly. And so we may want to refer you to an estate planning attorney. The benefit of having us refer you to an estate planning attorney is they're generally going to discount their fees because, I mean, there's dozens of attorneys we work with and we know who to go to. Estate planning costs are definitely getting higher and higher, and we've seen estate planning attorneys charging as much as $6,000 these days, and you can get it done for way less. And so, yes, we can help you and guide you in the right direction, but we are not the attorneys that will do the work or certainly can help guide you in the right direction, which I think you'll find helpful.

**You**: Identify.

**Other**: Great. How do I look up any old 401 from previous employers? How can I get those monies into Empower? Yeah. So I'm just laughing for a second because Jasmine and I have seen so many different scenarios, some of which were literally people can't identify or have forgotten. I don't know who my old 401k provider was. And so tracking it down is going to your old employer. Sometimes they weren't helpful. And so then, you know, searching online, which can be kind of the biggest adventure of them all. But generally, either you are getting statements from your old employer 401. And so by that, you know, sending that statement to us, or reading the statement, you say, okay, it's with fidelity, there's a number to call with fidelity or whoever that is. If you don't know who the old record keeper is, then you would call your old employer and ask them if you don't know if you have 401s from old employers or not. That's going to be the biggest adventure because, you know, we don't know either. Reach out in the right direction. I guess there's no really good solid answer for that question. Nika. I'm sorry. It's usually like just any old statements or if you look in your, your past email, you'll get something from. And once you find out what record keeper they're at. So let's say there's another one at, you know, American phones or anything like that. There's always a phone number. And they can look you up via your Social Security number. So they'll be able to tell you what your balance is or anything like that. And then you just tell them, I want to roll it over into my new 401K. And every single record keeper has a process for it and they will guide you. Through it. But, yeah, it's. It really is just like looking through your old statements, looking through old mail, like there really is no. Like, great way to find that out. Awesome. Thank you, jasmine. Okay, so let's keep rolling through. And again, we're not limited to those questions. We'll have more time at the end, so let's continue on to the next slide. So this is a little bit on investments. So your investment menu has target date funds, mutual funds, and what are called exchange traded funds. And so they're funds. And many of you would say, man, So what am I actually invested in? I want to invest in Microsoft or I want to invest in Google? Well, the good news is this, that these funds invest in individual stocks. And so they're a fund of stocks or a basket of stocks. And here's some of the stocks that are in the funds that you have access to owning. I would imagine if many of you are looking at this, you're saying invested in many of these companies. These are, you know, big companies. And whether they're global companies or whether they're, you know, United States companies, their companies that are profitable in growing and is an investor, you have a chance to invest in the growth of the world. These funds represent. So.

**You**: I would like to be.

**Other**: Moved on to the next slide. This is the list of funds. And if this is a little bit too small for you to read, we will send this presentation to Nika. And these are all funds you have access to, seeing and clicking and doing some research on, on the Empower website. So these funds, there's, there's many funds from American fund and investment fund manufacturer, also known as Capital Group. And so their target date is the best in breed over the last five years. And so you can see what some of the year to date performances are. You can see the one year, the three year, five year and then you know, even a ten year or inception average and so all these numbers have one thing in common during this period, these periods of time is they're all positive. Now, if we were to go back to 2022, there would be some negatives because 2022 was a tough year in the economy and in the general stock market is interest rates spiked and went up all the time lows that put a lot of pressure on these companies and their, Their profitability. So this list of funds, there's different categories of what they're invested in. And if you're a very conservative person, you probably want to be invested in what's called fixed income or bonds or. Something that's more conservative and balanced. If you are younger, you would want to be invested more in stock or what's called equity funds. And so if some of these terms are confusing to you,

**You**: Useful. In many. Of these.

**Other**: Then the easiest thing to do is to say, hey, I just want one fund to invest in, knowing that it's really geared towards helping me hit my goals. And so you would think about, okay, well, how old are you? And then what age do you want to retire? Do the math on that. And then when you look at the target date fund. So it's fund number three on down. I think there's probably 12 of them. They have these different dates on them. So there's target date 25, target date 30, target date 35. And every. Every five years, there's a new target date that gets issued. And what. That means is they are taking more risk in a more long term approach now and then as they get closer to that date, they're taking significantly less risk. More fixed income and bonds. So that target date fund that says 2010, you say, Ben, why do we have a target date 2010 fund? It's because Those are the people who are in retirement and they have a very, very conservative, you know, portfolio style. And they want to be in something that is really built towards just principal protection is what it's called. So those funds tend to be less performing over a long clip of time, but they also are significantly less when the market's jumping around. So this is why we show this. This piece to you.

**You**: Vol. Atile.

**Other**: Jasmine. Anything to add to that? I think I really. We have a colleague here who, like, he really breaks it down. With stocks, you're an owner, and bonds, you're a loaner. So stocks, you're going to own parts of these companies, but they're a bit more volatile, and with bonds, you're loaning money to these. Companies. So you're going to get your, your money back, the principal. So that's the principal protection, but you're also going to make, you know, a little bit on top of that. But it's not be as good as getting the money back from, but the stock, once it's, it's out there, you don't have as much principal protection. So these target date funds. Yeah. The longer time horizon that you have, there are going to be more heavily invested in stocks, in equities. That's what they're also called. And as you get closer to that target fund, it's going to rebalance itself to more bond heavy. So these target AP funds are basically just like rebalancing itself. If you want to do it yourself, you totally can. There are other options. You would just have to kind of keep your. Eye much closer to the stock market and be changing your percentages all the time just based on what you would want to do. So you do have the option to do that, but we always recommend the targeted funds because it rebalances for you. And another cool thing, too, is if you look at the far right column, it's the expense ratio. This is what the fund expenses are. So some of you may know that if you were to go to, you know, Fidelity and open up a personal brokerage account and you go to buy some Fidelity mutual fund, sometimes the expenses can be 60 basis points or 100 basis points. What that means is 0.6% or 1% is, is what the cost is for the fund. But if you look at this, that first one, the expense ratio is 31 basis points. So it's, you know, basically 1/3 of 1%. So that's significantly less than 1%. And then also, if you keep going down towards the bottom, you see that there's some index funds which have a significantly less lower expense ratio, less cost. And so some of those costs you may see here four basis points, two basis points. So it's not even a tenth of a percent. And why that is is because there's no mutual fund manager making daily stock changes inside the portfolio. You're just buying an index. And that index is what it is. You're ebbing and flowing with the performance of the index, which many people believe is, you know, there's no mutual fund managers that are really doing it better than the index itself. And so there's a lot of research on that. But you can make your own decision. And that's one of the reasons why we have those low cost options in the plan. So let's move to the next slide. Okay, so this is a busy slide, but let me break it down very simply for you. So these are the top 10 companies in the United States by decade. And we start the first column, it's all green, is 1985. And then the next column is 1995, then 2005, then 2015, and 2025. So the interesting thing about this is that nobody that was a top 10 company in 1985 is still a top 10 company in 2025. But if we look at some of those companies, there's still some good companies there on that list in 85 General Motors, GE, Exxon, IBM. And so as you look at how that changes, the point is that does it make more sense to pick an individual company or to pick a sector of the market or just to pick the general index itself? And so, again, it's up for you to choose, but we thought this is a very interesting slide to show you the other. One last component of this slide wanted to show is that people say often, well, you know, the market's going up. How much more can it go up? Well, the world is built to keep growing. Our population grows, technology grows, companies grow. And so the velocity of money is growing. And you can see in 85, the market cap of those 10 companies was $251 billion. Now, the market capitalization of the top 10 companies in 2025 is 19,004. Hundred eleven. Billion dollars. So a significant increase. And ultimately, this just shows that our world's growing. And being an investor is historically a very good thing to do because you're benefiting from the growth of the world. Let's go to the next slide. You're on mute. Jasmine. Oh, my God. Okay, so this next slide, it's the last graph we're going to show you, and then we're going to just open it up to questions. But this is a really. I really like the slide. It's a really important slide that we show. So this shows the returns and intra year. Declines. So what this means is basically at the end of the year. So at the end of 2025, the market was up 16%. But this little red dot, we'll show you what it was at at the lowest during the year. So this is. So I think the market went down to about 9 negative 19% during 2025. And I will tell you, we got a lot of calls during that time of people, you know, who. Not just our 401k participants, but we also had, you know, our clients, our wealth management clients, you know, calling us, being like, what? What should I do? Should I pull out of the market? What should I do? And so why we show this slide is to show you that this always happens. This has happened historically. Anytime that, that we have a really great year, there is always going to be at some point in the year where the market was down and where everybody was freaking out thinking it was never going to recover. And this is to just show you that it always recovers. So 35 out of the last 46 years we have, there has been a positive return on, in the market. So this is to just show you that at any point to just, just kind of let the market do its thing, the market will always recover it's one of those things that's just always going to happen when you hear all of that noise on TV and this and this is happening and this, and, you know, we're going here, we're going there just to, to know that, to just kind of keep calm and carry on, because it will. It will recover. And there are. It will be okay. But it can look really scary at times. Especially. We were all kind of looking and it was going down. It was down at, like, negative 19%. And I think it was, like, in April. And then the day after that, it recovered in, like, one day, which was, like, the. The most the market has ever recovered in one day. So had you pulled out all your money? That day before, you wouldn't have been there for that 10% recovery. So what? Yeah, we just. This is just to show you that market will always do crazy things, but it will just balance itself out and end up at a positive. Awesome. And so here are just some of our resources and tools. You know, Google and the Internet. Just, you know, be careful with those. I know we have AI now, so just be careful. But, you know, it's always a great resource to just kind of do your own research and things like that. Empower, they. Empower has a lot of your own tools as well. They are really, really helpful. We are a tool ourselves. Navigators trustandwill.com is what Ben was mentioning. If you have a simple, you know, you own a house and, and you want to make a trust, if you don't have all these, like, kind of difficult things going on, trustandwill.com is a great way to just put it all in. It's about. It can be about 500 to $700, but it's a lot cheaper than hiring an estate attorney, which I think they start at like 2500, so. And trust and will be made by a state attorney. So if it is very, very simple, it's. Really easy. You just go and they give you. They just spit out all your paperwork, and you can go and get it notarized at, like, a UPS store for, like, 15 bucks. It's really, really great. If it's. If it's more complicated than that, we can definitely point you in the right direction of an estate attorney. But house regular healthcare directive and will super simple budgeting tools. Quicken every dollar, Copilot. You need a budget. I still use an Excel sheet, so whatever is any type of.

**You**: Really helps.

**Other**: You guys, but this is our contact information. But, yeah, so definitely want to open it up again to questions. Anybody. Needs to know. Yeah. And there might have been a couple other questions in the chat. Nika, did you see? Yeah. In power. How do we check which option we're currently on? I think she means yeah. Yeah, that'll be just on your website. You'll just go into your settings. You'll see, like, you'll be able to pick what investment you want to be in, and it'll have your current. Investment in there. So if you want to change it or anything like that. Jasmine, this is Lorena. I'm the one put the question in. So I'm in power, and I think when I signed up, you know, I chose a default one from your advice, and, you know, I'm now less than five years. Away from retirement, and I just want to make sure that I'm in the right. Categories based on what we talked about earlier. You know, more kind of thing. And I see my percentages, but I, I don't know if I should be messing with these or is there another default one I can choose at this point? When we talk about that 10K and the five, you know, the one year that truck that you had up? Yeah. Yes. So I think that that's probably more of, like, a specific question. So you can reach out to us so we can see, like, what your percentages are at and how it's. How it's set up, if we need to make it, if we would recommend any changes. Because. Yeah. Definitely shoot me an email and we can go through it. Maybe send me, like, a screenshot of where it's at now, and then we can, like, let you know. If there's anything you know in Loretta, if you're. If you're. If you haven't changed anything since your last statement. We'll just pull up your statement. And so then we'll review it, and then we'll reach out to you. I definitely haven't made any changes. I'll send it. I'll grab a screenshot of that too, though. Should I just email? Do I do it to both of you, or does it matter? I took a screenshot of your email. So. Yeah, it doesn't matter either one. Okay? We'll do. Thank you. And then Kevin has a question. If you want to ask because it's regarding investing. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. I keep hearing that they're like energy funds. You dump money in there and you get a nice quarterly return from them. Is that should you move your money from a 401k into something like that when you. Well, I'm trying to figure out what's the best way to get, you know, a steady return, whatever that is. On. It's a great question, Kevin. And so it's kind of like, hey, the age old question is, okay, what is the best sector or what is the best investment for me to be in? And do you want growth of the portfolio or do you want a dividend? Do you want, can you, can you stock some volatility to get that growth. And so the idea of kind of a steady performance would kind of gear more towards a conservative return, but it really becomes a little bit more of an individual question. And depending on your age and how close you are to retirement, you really can't invest in certain types of funds. Well, any funds outside of the investment mix you have until you're basically 60 years old. And then you could do all the in service withdrawal to or in service rollover. Better yet, and then you could do something more targeted in the energy space. But there's some comparable funds to what you're kind of alluding to here, however, you can't take distributions. So when they're giving you a dividend, those dividends would just have to be reinvested in the current account. So if you have more questions, Kevin, I'd be happy to have a call with you. And, you know, we'd be happy to. Help kind of guide you in the right direction. I think we understand the spirit of what you're asking, so I think there's. There's some things that you can be doing inside your 401k portfolio that would give you what you're looking for. Thanks. Are there any other questions? In general. Before we go, Nika, I just want to, you know, kind of communicate to everybody that, like you said, Nick, at the top of the meeting, it's January. It's a great time to set some goals. I just want to encourage everyone to set at least one financial goal for the year. And whether it's you know, getting that savings up to $1,000 or a certain number, or whether it's increasing your 401k contribution by 1%. Just find some achievable goal and put it in place and then celebrate it at the end of the year and then we get back together, you know, we'll all make sure to, you know, give you attaboy or add a girl. And, you know, it's good to set goals and achieve them. I don't know. I just think there's something in our DNA that makes us feel good about that. Yeah. And with Empower, you know, you can make changes anytime to your contributions. There is a feed to our payroll system every Thursday. So it's the Thursday, the week before we get paid. So there's a feed that goes over every other week and we'll directly update the payroll system. But so you can make changes at the, you know, towards the end of the year. Make sure you're at where you want to be. You can still make changes towards the end of the year if you still want to contribute more. Let us know if you have questions. Or contact Jasmine and Ben directly for some personal retirement guidance and investment guidance. And we appreciate you, Ben and Jasmine joining us today. And I will send out a copy of the presentation. Awesome. Thank you, Nika. Thank you, everybody. Thanks. Have a good one. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Take care.
