## Transcript

**You**: Hello. What's up? Okay? How about you?

**Other**: Still trying to figure out. How to carve out some clear space for me to sit in my house in the aftermath of Christmas.

**You**: Office doesn't work.

**Other**: Well, it's full of all the plants that used to be downstairs with a Christmas tree. Was. I am in the office right now. I finally just put all the plants on the floor. But we have to move everything back downstairs, which I can't do because the Christmas tree made such a mess that I had to shampoo the carpet under where it was, and it's still wet.

**You**: I was volunteering at Luca's school.

**Other**: Good. I don't know if it answered too many of my questions, but I learned a few things. I still don't know how I feel about it there. And I also don't know. You never know. People act different because you're there. Some of the things he's told me the teacher does, I'm like, really? But I assume he's exaggerating because she seems perfectly lovely and like all the other volunteers seem to love her. She seems perfectly lovely. I don't freaking know. I don't think. I don't think she's a bad teacher, per se, but. My issues with the school are mostly. There's not enough recess. It's like a nine minute recess. One a day. Which I think is a freaking crime. For six year olds. And it's because they don't have a playground. So at recess, they just go right in the parking lot. Which I went to recess with him, and the kids were having a perfectly lovely time running in the parking lot. So, like, that doesn't seem like an excuse not to give them recess. Like, I know. That your playground sucks, but the kids don't care. They just want to be outside running and doing something besides getting told what to do for 20 minutes. And it should be longer. It should be more than one a day. So that bothers me. I also think they watch. A lot of videos. Like, is that normal?

**You**: I don't know.

**Other**: It's a lot of video watching going on. They're not long, you know, but, like, it seems like most of the instruction is videos.

**You**: Interesting.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Yeah, that's not common in my experience. But I don't have kindergarten experience at all.

**Other**: Right? Like, it's probably because it gets their attention. You know, but like I. He says, when they first get to school, the first thing they do is watch a video. And I'm sure that's to get them all butts and, you know.

**You**: Right.

**Other**: And then there are several. Their math instruction is mostly videos, and that's probably because of the language barrier. Like, how is this teacher, who English isn't great and the kids can barely understand her, supposed to teach math? You know? So.

**You**: Videos can do. Like they. They make construction. In theory, you get. Consistent instruction across the classrooms.

**Other**: Yeah. Right. And they're not long videos or anything, but they're also, like. They're pretty lame. Like, I saw some of them and they're, like, ancient and on a projector. Like, they're not exactly, like. And I guess, who cares? Like, you know, they're getting their point across, and I don't. Care. You know, he's not learning anything from it with them because it's shapes and stupid stuff. But it is. It seems like a lot of videos, and then, like, it's like they do. They watch a video and then they do worksheets, and they watch a video and they do worksheets, and I'm like, this is excruciatingly boring. Like I'm bored. Like. No wonder he's bored. But. You know he likes to watch videos. But it seems like that's kind of the rhythm of their day until lunch. Watch a video, do a worksheet, watch a video, do some worksheets. And then there was, like, a little activity that involved, like, cubes with syllables on it. And you roll the cubes, and then you write down the syllables, and it's like, all right, I get it. You try to make an activity. So that they weren't just watching a video and doing worksheet. I don't. I don't know how to create. To expect a teacher to be. Or a classroom, you know, like, it's just like it ought to be.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: More interesting than that. But I. What do I know? I don't know what. I don't know what's normal. So it felt like very. Just two classroomy for six year olds, you know, and the kids were, you know, like, the teacher was like, I, I thought she might be stricter than she was, but like, when they're working on the worksheets, kids were up wandering around doing things and she wasn't like getting mad at them, like. You know, they. They weren't expected to sit in their desk and stay 100% on task or anything, so that made me feel kind of better, like nobody was getting yelled at for wandering around.

**You**: And what's Luca getting in trouble for?

**Other**: I think he didn't. I mean, he was perfectly lovely the whole time I was there, and I wasn't really paying a lot of attention to him because he didn't need help. You know, my job was to go around, help the kids who need help with their worksheets. I don't know. I mean, I could guess. And just because it didn't happen in that 90 minute window doesn't mean.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: It doesn't happen. But he was definitely. He was on task. He did his work. He was one of the first ones to finish. With everything they went through. So. And he's back at a desk with other kids. But he's seated next to the two quietest kids in the class, who did not say a word the entire time I was there. Which I'm sure is on purpose.

**You**: Great.

**Other**: There's combinations of kids in there that would have been problematic. And so maybe the teacher. It just took her a while to figure out which combinations there are.

**You**: Yeah. Seating charts at that age. Make a big difference.

**Other**: A big deal. But the Reese's thing gets me. And then pe. They're supposed to have PE Every day, which is supposed to be, like, how they make up for. Their. You know, it's their excuse for not having recess. But the PE teacher is young and sucks and doesn't know how to control the kids. And when they misbehave, he just makes them all sit. And so there. There goes their movement. These luga is often like all we did in PE Was sit today because nobody was listening.

**You**: Right. Cheers.

**Other**: Like, if they're not listening, give them free play. I'm sorry. They're five.

**You**: Y. Eah.

**Other**: And six years old. They just need to move their bodies. Who cares if you're teaching them anything?

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: It's pee.

**You**: The high performing charter school kind of system is you do that until it's perfect and then you teach your first thing.

**Other**: Y. Ep. Yeah. And I think what I'm learning is that I don't really care about high performing right now.

**You**: Right.

**Other**: I will in middle and high school. And right now it's like, just let them freaking play and run. Who cares? I don't know.

**You**: It doesn't sound terrible. It sounds like some work you're going to make it through this year unless something crazy happens.

**Other**: It's not terrible. Yeah, yeah, we're not. I was never trying to change anything mid year unless it was like, you know, if he started refusing to go to school every day, but it's really only after breaks, you know, and he's happy when I pick him up. And I truly don't think anything terrible is happening there. He's just bored.

**You**: I bet mom would have some things to say about this.

**Other**: I can't talk about it. I have. She's too emotional. Emotional about anything ever not being perfect for Luca. He is like her firstborn or something. The way she gets, you know, everything is an emergency. If it's not perfect for him.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: She will think any school he's at is terrible because it's not optimizing his creativity and all this stuff. And I agree. But I don't have $20,000 a year to fix it.

**You**: Right. I was just thinking, like, for us, she started volunteering at the school.

**Other**: Yeah. Because she could be there all day, every day. She started program. She actually made changes and a difference at what was going on at the school. She taught our advanced reading classes.

**You**: Exactly.

**Other**: So, yeah, I'm not going to do that. So I just, you know, I'm torn on, like. Whether the charter thing in the Spanish thing is enough of an advantage. Emmy's school sounds way more interesting in the, like, she has, like, technology class, and they have music class, toys a week, and they have, you know, things that Luca's school just doesn't have the resources for. So there's more rotating things going on.

**You**: What school is that?

**Other**: Sato, just the. The regular, you know, like, the problem is. So our. Our neighborhood school, like Sato, the one he would get on the school bus and go to, is one of the top 20 schools in the state.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: So part of me is like, aren't we just going there?

**You**: Y. Eah.

**Other**: Like I do want to learn Spanish, but also. You know, and they teach engineering. They have an engineering after school program. Like, these are the things he's interested in. He does love the learning Spanish, and I love that for him as but it's not worth his whole day, every day. If it's not great. Otherwise we can teach him Spanish our own selves if we.

**You**: Yeah, you can figure out a supplemental Spanish. Option.

**Other**: Right. And he probably won't be as good. He will be less likely to be, like, properly, you know.

**You**: Correct. It's interesting as AJ Is going through this, she's dead set on him going to a Spanish dual language school, and I'm fully supportive of it, but it severely limits your options.

**Other**: Bilingual, but.

**You**: And those schools will have their own problems.

**Other**: Right. Y.

**You**: And they're probably never the best school.

**Other**: Ep? Yep.

**You**: By general measures. And they're going to be further away.

**Other**: Yep. I understand from her perspective why it's the most important thing.

**You**: We're in a different situation.

**Other**: Like, for Jennette, she feels kind of the same way. Like, it would have to be terrible. For her to take Willow out of a dual language school. And it's not terrible. Like, it's not. It is a good school. Like, I. And it might be that in higher grades, I really like it, you know, Like, I don't know yet.

**You**: True. And if they fix the PE teacher, it can make a difference.

**Other**: It might be. And if they fix the PE Teacher and the kids actually get to run around for a half an hour a day, So. Yeah, I don't. There. There's. It's supposed to be a good school. It is. Not ranked as high as Sato, but I don't really care about school rankings. That's just their damn test scores. Like, you know, I don't. But. Sato does have more resources, and they also have. A lot better support for kids who. Are outside the box in some way. They've got on staff psychs and counseling stuff, which I do think Luca is going to need and Argo doesn't. They have to call in someone from the district, which means good luck and they won't be available on the regular. And. Good Lord, we could just put him on a school bus.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: At some point, you have to consider your own. And there I'm willing to make sacrifices. If I was like, this is 100% the right place for him to be, but if I'm not sure it's the right place for him to be, why are we taking an hour out of our day every day. To do the round trip school pickup.

**You**: That's a lot of work.

**Other**: It's a lot.

**You**: Yep. Yep.

**Other**: But if Jennet ever quits going.

**You**: Yeah, you're screwed. Are you carpooling? Is that what's happening?

**Other**: We have. To. She drives him every morning.

**You**: Oh, well. You pick them up.

**Other**: And we pick up. Yeah, and we alternate pickup, but, you know, we have to leave it 2:30 for pickup and good luck actually functionally getting back to work after that.

**You**: Totally.

**Other**: You know, it just doesn't happen. So twice a week in my workday ends at 2:30 for that school pickup. And once a week forest camp makes it a useless day. And like that had been. Not the end of the world. I have no idea how sustainable that's going to be. Now.

**You**: Y. Eah.

**Other**: Especially if they hire us a boss who has, like, I, you know, a plan and isn't I all time?

**You**: Right.

**Other**: Like if somebody starts checking on what I'm doing, this isn't work anymore. Yeah. Part of me is like, can you imagine? What if we just put them on a school bus? The bus comes for Soto at 7:05, which is part of what I was fighting against before that early.

**You**: Right? But you just adjust to it, and then it's just normal.

**Other**: But. We adjust our lives around it. And part of it, you know, I was like, I'll never see my kids if they go to school that early. But it's like, if I met my desk at 7:15, I can end my workday at 2:45 when they get off the bus.

**You**: Thank God. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

**Other**: I'm done, and then I have all afternoon to hang out with my kids. Instead of spending all this time in the car and then getting home and then having to be in a rush and.

**You**: Well, probably thinking about this for next year, right? So you got some time to.

**Other**: So. Yeah. This is all in next year decision. I'm not doing anything right now. Unless something really weird happens. But this is. Yeah, I'm just. I, I. I had hoped that I wouldn't need to spend my January in February of every single year of my life obsessing about what school my kids are going to go to. But, like, I thought maybe we'd be done with Arco and it would just. Be fine. No such luck. Jake's gonna hate wearing uniform, too. Like giant fight every day to get him to not wear his soccer stuff.

**You**: Oh, it's uniform school.

**Other**: It's a uniform. Yeah.

**You**: Cute.

**Other**: He makes fun of it when Luca wears it.

**You**: Y. Eah. Whereas Jake wears a uniform every day, too. It's just a soccer one.

**Other**: Yeah, but his own choosing.

**You**: Fun.

**Other**: And, you know, I don't know, like, what would be better about Sato? Maybe they're doing the exact same thing, but they at least have more different classes. Like the rotation of specials. Arco doesn't do that. There's no music class. There's no, you know.

**You**: That's. A bummer.

**Other**: Technology. Emmy was doing, like, robotics or something the other day. Like, well, maybe Argo do that in second grade. I don't know, but. Sato is. Is because of the neighborhood. So it's like 70% Indian or something. Like, it's crazy. And they're very focused on engineering.

**You**: Y. Ep.

**Other**: But, like, Luca will love that. Like, there's so. It's so heavily Indian. They have Indian food on the lunch menu twice a week.

**You**: That's remarkable. All right, well, should we try and do some work? I have not really read through your comments on the TRD yet. So if that's what we're working on, we should probably just go through it together, I guess.

**Other**: Yeah. It might make more sense that way anyway, because otherwise, if you had further questions or it required discussion, then you're just making changes, you know? Then we have to find your changes later and go through that, so. Okay? Let's see. I have still not figured out how to get cursor to show me. Changes. Like VS code. If I change stuff in a file, I could look at them next to each other and see the green and the red and whatnot.

**You**: Okay, you want to share your screen?

**Other**: Maybe we can figure that out, because I look through all the settings and everything, and I just don't have a clue how to get it to do that. Okay? So, like, I know I can go look at the commit or whatever and see the stuff. And maybe that's the easiest way to do it.

**You**: Yeah, so. Before you commit and push, you can just use. The source tree tab on the left to, like, see changes, but you don't have any outstanding changes right now.

**Other**: Right now? I don't know, but it used to be, like, it would. I could easily see, like, two tabs of this, and the other one would show. It used to be. And I don't know how to make.

**You**: Yeah. Well, so make a change and save it. Just type blossom or. And. Then. If you click on it under changes on the left, it's source control. Is that what you're looking for? Okay?

**Other**: Yeah, it is, actually.

**You**: So until you commit, that's the best way to do that.

**Other**: Code used to do that automatically or something. Or. I don't remember how I did it in there, but it was.

**You**: There's, like, 10 different ways to view these. I don't understand them either, but that's. This is the way I do it, typically.

**Other**: Okay? Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Okay, Good to know. But once it's committed, then you can't go see.

**You**: I think if you go in the. The left tab at the bottom half, I think you can click those previous commits. And, like, it'll show you the change log for, like, if you click. Yeah, that.

**Other**: Aha. Okay. Cool. That's not something I normally need, but. Good Lord, though, showing that.

**You**: Right? Well, yeah, that appears to. It seems like something you did or I did. Formatted the document. Formatting is a nightmare. Because it makes change sense. Impossible to read.

**Other**: Everywhere.

**You**: So either you have something that automatically formats markdown, or I do.

**Other**: I saw some automatic formatting happening when I was saving, but it wasn't. It didn't look big like this. It was like.

**You**: Okay? So.

**Other**: It would fix the dashes at the end of a line and stuff.

**You**: Yeah. The commit I saw from you, 90% of it was hyphens. Literally. I can't read half of it because it looks like this. So.

**Other**: Well, here's the good news. Whenever I put a comment. That needed discussion. I put like, pound pound for it because I didn't see that.

**You**: Pound. Pound.

**Other**: Too many. But I should have chosen something better.

**You**: So open a cursor chat.

**Other**: How. Do I get new?

**You**: I don't know.

**Other**: Chats again. I forget.

**You**: Yours looks so different than mine's. Probably the cube in the top, right. That weird cubey thingy. To. The right. Yeah.

**Other**: There we go.

**You**: And then push the plus button.

**Other**: That. I usually.

**You**: And say, can you remove any automatic formatting of markdown files? In cursor. It does stuff like this too. It's amazing. And then you can also later in another chat ask it what are my options for viewing diffs both before and after I commit changes?

**Other**: But, like, even if it removes the automatic formatting,

**You**: Well, it's too late for this time around. This is for future sh.

**Other**: Right, okay.

**You**: Or fucked for this one. And. Then, yeah. Accept. And. That should probably fix it.

**Other**: Great.

**You**: For the future. And the only option we have now is to just go through manually and look for your comments. Or we could ask. We could ask Claude. To fix it. Say, hey. Something fucked with formatting when I was adding comments and it's making it unreadable. Can you fix it? And it will. Probably fix it. This is the world we live in now.

**Other**: But, like. Fix it. How?

**You**: Try. It. There's no risk. Open a new Push plus and just type. Over the last two commits.

**Other**: To. Get this cover of the school meat off of my screen. There we go. Okay.

**You**: Over the last couple of commits.

**Other**: Okay? So.

**You**: I added comments and edited a markdown file. But something automatically formatted it. Which makes the diff impossible to read. I'd like to clean this up so I can read a clean diff. Just showing. My comments and changes. And just hit enter.

**Other**: I'm asking it to give me a list of my real changes.

**You**: You're asking at a much more general question. You're just telling it your problem, seeing if it fixes it, because I don't know how to fix it.

**Other**: And you get me a diff that only show.

**You**: Can you? Can you? Sure? Yeah, do whatever you want. I don't know. What the right prompt is. We just try shit until it works. And I'll show you how to revert if it goes off the rails.

**Other**: S.

**You**: Yep. Found. It. See, anytime. You don't know anything. You just gotta. You just gotta remember that Cloud's smarter than you. It's really weird.

**Other**: Y.

**You**: It's really weird. You're only agency. Is knowing what direction you're going. And your only blocker is trying to do it yourself. And stopping because it's too much work. Because it's not too much work anymore.

**Other**: Eah. It's been really helpful for things like. Finding duplicate stuff. When people are like, what classes do I have my standards duplicated in? And there's like a spreadsheet or, like, Making those stupid. Score label maps for standard or for conversions. Which is such a pain in the ass. It doesn't take that long, but it's really obnoxious work. Doing? There. Claudia. Meaningful changes. Last two commits text.

**You**: Like about right?

**Other**: 127.

**You**: So then just. Click on the file. It's right on the. Yeah.

**Other**: But, like. Now we have to find all these.

**You**: Well, you just aren't done yet.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: You say? What I really like is to undo all the formatting so that. The changes are visible. The main file.

**Other**: But. Won't. That. Won't that. Just make another diff that. Like, undoes it all, but it doesn't. It's not going to give me.

**You**: Yeah, probably. That doesn't mean don't hit enter in co. Anyway? I don't know. I don't know how you want to go through this. I'll follow your advice. Okay?

**Other**: The other thing. I mean, if it just gave us the line number of each of these things.

**You**: Well, you just copy and search, probably.

**Other**: It would be.

**You**: Same number of clicks. Is typing in a line number.

**Other**: What it. Does here.

**You**: That's the right move. Thank you. Claude. Store the original, apply the changes.

**Other**: It'll be reasonably close to what I actually did, right?

**You**: I don't know.

**Other**: Don't feel like I. Did 251 edits, but.

**You**: Yeah, it's too much. Give up. Let's just stop writing this, not do anything. Anyway. What do you. What's the thrust here? What do you. What do you think we need to do? Forget about the diff file.

**Other**: My biggest question is, how accurate do these need to be? You know?

**You**: They don't need to be accurate at all.

**Other**: Thank you. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking. In which case.

**You**: We're. Done.

**Other**: You don't need to do anything and I can just make go figure out make decision. Or we could just be done. Yeah like. But there are questions in it. Like my comments are questions. I don't think we can give it to somebody. Like, if anybody ever comes back and says, like, you didn't do what this says, We would like to mostly done what it says, right? So like, that's my only like. Accuracy thing. That and. Making sure we've thought through. What changes to family accounts are going to look like when kids move around. Because, like. But I'm. I'm no longer super worried that this is going to get. Implemented to a level that we can't handle the support next year. You know where I was before, like, oh, we got to get this right. And now it's like, it's not going to be worse or bigger than New York City. So. So what?

**You**: Right.

**Other**: The problems if we don't get it exactly right or not. That bad, and we can just. Deal with them when they come up. I think. The biggest thing that I wondered I think about family accounts, especially if someone is using. Messaging. Is. Continuity of that. Like, how important is that? Like, if their kid moves to a different school or whatever?

**You**: They're not going to use our current messaging product. And we'll add that to. The recs for the new communic. Ation product.

**Other**: Right, like, it might now. I. I mean, like, right now, like. A lot of times, problem solving for these. These issues that come up involves me deleting things. Which would ruin that. The continuity. Right? But. But it doesn't really matter if a kid New York City, if a kid goes to a different school, they don't expect their messages from the old school to be visible to the new school, like a district in California might expect that, you know, and so, like, if the account gets screwed up, The solution might be different, and the screwing up of it might be a bigger deal. I don't know. You know? That was the thing that made me nervous.

**You**: Don't worry about messaging. That's not. It's not part of this. Deal with it in the messaging. App.

**Other**: I know, but the account management is. You know, like we should be not be. The fact that we should not delete and recreate a family account if the kid moves to a new school is probably worth considering. I don't know. Like how we handle accounts when kids move around is really messy in New York. It's a source of all sorts of headaches that I fix however I need to fix, right? And so I didn't know how detailed we wanted to get sitting here and, like, specking out exactly what should happen in every scenario. Technically.

**You**: It depends on how much you care.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: I don't care.

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: You're no longer under the umbrella of me caring.

**Other**: Yeah. I care only in, like, you know, how I don't know how pissed someone will be if they lose their messaging history or, you know, I have no idea.

**You**: Yeah, we'll find out.

**Other**: What the expectations would be with that. And in our, you know, without messaging in the accounts, like, it just doesn't matter. You can delete and rec.

**You**: Nobody is going to use our messaging product with Aries. Period. We're building a new messaging product. It's completely different. And I will have a requirement in there if we need it. That is continuity between moving schools.

**Other**: I know I'm thinking about the new one, but is it. Okay? And we can think about how that affects accounts later.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: Okay, that's fine.

**You**: I don't think it's going to ever get built.

**Other**: The other thing.

**You**: So we're wasting our time thinking about it. That Comms product is not going to happen.

**Other**: Yeah. Okay?

**You**: Best. Guess.

**Other**: Okay? There's not really anything else in here that makes me nervous, I don't think. If I just do whatever I want? In these tech requirements because, you know, obviously, If it's not exactly right, you're not going to build it wrong because the tech requirement is wrong, so I don't care. But I don't under there. You might want to read through the parts about SAML and stuff. I did nothing there because I don't understand the tech requirements. So if you care. The saml parts. And the. There was one other thing. That I put a note that I think, but now I can't find it. So one option would be if we truly are not super worried about the accuracy of this. Where did it put this file? It says it's done the markdown file to its original formatting. Reapplied your content changes diff now shows only your actual edits. Does it mean? This one? Where? Where does the diff only show? My actual link.

**You**: I. Think you have to type that command it gave you in or tell it. Where you tell it. How can I view this in vs code? Can. We rebase and squash commits or something, I don't know. But, I mean, we should read through your comments. One way or. The other. And make sure.

**Other**: When you were looking at it in BitBucket or whatever, could you find my comments with less of a mess or was it just as bad?

**You**: Let's. Take a look. Yes, your first commit. 90%. I mean, you can go in there and look, you go to BitBucket, you go to Commits, you pick your branch.

**Other**: Yeah, I just want to. General idea.

**You**: I can share my screen if you want, but it's the same as what you're looking at, basically.

**Other**: Okay, so it's not easier to find. Okay?

**You**: Although the second commit is because it didn't reformat.

**Other**: Does. The formatting had already happened.

**You**: It appears so. Yeah. So I can. But I don't know. I don't know what I lost in the first commit. So I don't know if I should read the second commit without reading, trying to read the first commit or not. Or was the second commit where the important stuff happened? That's kind of what my question was.

**Other**: The first commit is the first 700 lines, and the next commit is the rest of it. Just as I was reading through.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: So. We could go through the second half if the first one is. Let me look at it real quick, since I sort of know what I am. Looking. Forward. And see if it's any easier for me.

**You**: I mean, I think that that first file it created. Is fairly usable. Just ugly.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: The one that says meaningful changes. I just don't have it. So you can only see it on your screen at the moment.

**Other**: Just ugly. Yeah.

**You**: It might have undone it. Anyway, there's a way you could power through this cloud and just keep saying okay. Now, how do I see the comments?

**Other**: Y. Eah.

**You**: I don't want to do it in the terminal. Undo and squash my last commits, but I don't have the patience to figure that out. We're 41 minutes in and haven't done anything yet.

**Other**: Right. Yeah, right. So maybe. I will just keep seeing what I can do to come up with. Something that we can, that is functional for us to look at and then decide.

**You**: Will you commit what you have and push it right now? Exactly what's there. Just commit that. Yeah.

**Other**: This thing.

**You**: Because.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: I think if we diff that against the first version, skip the other two. Then. We might have a chance.

**Other**: Okay? So. Really understand.

**You**: I'm taking it over for a sec.

**Other**: How that's going to.

**You**: Got. It now. Get the data first commit was. When. Okay? Find your first comment, let's talk about it. While I. Try and fix this.

**Other**: Okay? Are you looking at something that I should be.

**You**: I just find your first comment. That we should talk about. So that we can be doing something while I try and fix this diff. I would like to talk about the work. Not the formatting.

**Other**: Trying. This. Won't let me open any of the diffs because it says it's too large.

**You**: Okay? Too many hyphens.

**Other**: This would be. Faster. If I literally just.

**You**: That's what I mean. Just find a comment. I don't care about a diff. Let's try and talk about one thing.

**Other**: Some of the things I did, though, was like, just delete stuff that I was hoping you would be able to see that I just deleted, you know? So that you can verify it was right? I think it is. So it's probably like, I didn't do a ton of that. It felt like it was pretty obvious to me.

**You**: Okay, I just squashed the commits and what that means. Should. Have. I'm just going to see if the diffs looks clean. It means it takes the three commits you made and pretends it was one. And so you're just comparing the original to the third commit? And if it in fact. Undid the weird formatting. Shit. Wherever that came from, I have no idea why it would have done that. Then it might actually be readable in a bit. Bucket. Let me see. Y. Eah. It's perfect. So go. If you go, open BitBucket.

**Other**: Got it. I see it. Let me share my screen sharing right now. Is just the other screen. I fix this? We can look at the same thing together. So.

**You**: Right? This is basically what we want.

**Other**: Which looks like what we want. From first glance, yes.

**You**: Right. We're not going to do terms and marking periods.

**Other**: Okay, so.

**You**: Punted. On that.

**Other**: That's what I thought. So that stuff should get. Can I add comments to this so that I know what to change later? I can, right? But it's not to like a particular part. It's like.

**You**: Yeah, it does something. I don't know what it does. But it adds comments.

**Other**: I can just take notes. And then once I get my answers, I can go do what I need to do.

**You**: Yeah. And you can click on a line. And it'll add. A comment there. Like that little plus thing if you want. Or you could just make one big call.

**Other**: Oh, you. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah, that's what I want. Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay. Great. So now where will those.

**You**: I have. No idea.

**Other**: I see it. I see what it's doing, okay? I think that that will give me what I need to be able to go through this and make changes, okay? This whole thing here and Aries customer. It's saying Aries customers can be live on JumpRope within one day. I think that. Should not be written down somewhere.

**You**: Sure. Delete it.

**Other**: Because right.

**You**: It's fine.

**Other**: I'm just going to take that out. Because technically they can. But that's a total misrepresentation of.

**You**: Or you put in terms of data integration.

**Other**: Can. Yeah, I'll just clarify it, maybe.

**You**: And we shouldn't say one day. It should just be general. It should be like.

**Other**: No, we shouldn't.

**You**: Minimized steps. But nobody's going to read this, Jenna. Not a single person is ever going to read this.

**Other**: Okay? My only thought is, if they come back and they're like, well, you said it was in a do thing X. And then there's, like, documentation that it says something else.

**You**: And your rights to worry about that because that could fall on you. It's a 1% chance is my best guess, but I don't know either.

**Other**: Yeah. I agree. I agreed with that more before. I didn't know who was going to be in charge. What if they're good at their job?

**You**: Then they'll recognize that they don't need to manage us on this.

**Other**: Yeah, right.

**You**: But you're right. I don't know how this goes. Ellen might read it. That's true. Ellen might read it.

**Other**: Ellen might read it. So she can tell. That we're not doing our job correctly or something. Or so that she can waste a bunch of our time asking questions because it doesn't sound right. I wouldn't put it past.

**You**: 's fine. Yeah. I think that would be a really great use of her time.

**Other**: I would like it to be reasonably accurate. And I would. I would like it not to make promises that we know we can't.

**You**: Totally. So delete stuff liberally. Nobody's going to notice what's missing.

**Other**: Keep. Yeah.

**You**: For sure. Ellen doesn't know enough to know what's missing.

**Other**: Right, okay.

**You**: It turns out, by the way, that I am now the most senior person in the product division.

**Other**: What did I do here? I know. I had that thought. I know.

**You**: Which I immediately. Ellen pointed that out, and I was like, yeah, just pretend that's not true.

**Other**: Right. Pretend that you didn't notice that.

**You**: That might be my title.

**Other**: Never talk about that again.

**You**: We had a little laugh about it.

**Other**: You mean you don't want to be vp?

**You**: I do. Not want to be. Vp.

**Other**: No, I know. Can you imagine? Would be a miserable job. Right now. Okay? Let's see. This does not need discussion. It was just a clarification. I can just make this decision, but. This was just me saying I don't think we should put detailed stats right on the dashboard. You should have to click in. It was thinking that you should put. So I can just go ahead and say, that's fine if. If we don't care too much. So it says implement health check that flags imports that haven't run in an expected time frame.

**You**: Delete that. It just made that shit up.

**Other**: Okay. I couldn't decide whether to. Yeah, that's what I thought. I was never sure. Like, there were times when I was like, I'm just not sure, like, what documentation it was reading to come up with this. And so, like, I was like, oh, did somebody decide?

**You**: It might not. No. If it's not in the brd, it just decided that would be a nice feature because it's got a brain, probably.

**Other**: Okay? Y. Eah. This was just me making some edits that I don't think we need to talk about. Last line. Even an import that hasn't run in 26 hours. It should dis. Import, no. Right.

**You**: No.

**Other**: O. Kay. Again. I just was nervous that someone asked for that or something, and I was like, what? Okay? We're not coming back. We decided we don't need to care about the files. Right. You're not worried about those being accurate?

**You**: The what?

**Other**: The files. So it says, these are the files that we're editing. These are.

**You**: Yeah, ignore that.

**Other**: Creating so we can ignore anything that I had.

**You**: Leave it. Don't delete them, just.

**Other**: About?

**You**: Ignore it.

**Other**: I changed a few where I was like 100%. We are already doing that. And here's the file, so. But that I did that like, twice. Okay? This was just small changes to what the pages are actually called. We do not need to talk about any of that. Let's see. Giving us a successful import trigger. The application should display a progress indicator within 5 seconds showing the current stage.

**You**: Yeah, it's just importing.

**Other**: Right. Yeah, that does not need to be that specific. So I think.

**You**: This is interesting how detailed it tries to get. I asked it to be detailed and fill in details, but this is going to lead to over promises. That aren't necessary.

**Other**: Correct. And that's what I was trying to, like, do is like, I do not want this to say we're going to do something that we're not going to do. Even if nobody's going to read it. That makes me nervous. So, anyway.

**You**: Yeah. No, to be clear, it is good that you're reading this and deleting stuff. I just don't care because I don't really need it.

**Other**: Right. Well, more likely to come back on this stuff. Me.

**You**: But it won't. But it could.

**Other**: Right. Eventually. Not this time it won't, but it could. And, you know, like, I think that there. I have more at stake if there's things. These things become problematic than you do. So I have to care more than want to.

**You**: Correct. Totally. Totally. And I can absorb some of that. I can say. Oh, well. Quote, unquote, read this as I actually build it. I just don't have the patience to read it, edit it, wait a week, read it, do it again, then actually do it. But if I run into something as I'm building it that's like, fuck that, I'll delete it from the TRD2 and nobody.

**Other**: Sure. Yes, I know. Yeah.

**You**: There's a lot of leeway here.

**Other**: And we are not allowed to do that. Like, nobody said you can't change the tech requirements as you get into them. Like, I think we were explicitly told we can.

**You**: Nobody's told me that. Well, and I believe you have to ask a senior director in order to get those changed.

**Other**: You might.

**You**: That's me. I. Don't have any idea.

**Other**: Yeah, I don't. We're not going to have it. Test permissions and API connectivity and stuff.

**You**: No. Anything that just looks.

**Other**: Just going to.

**You**: Think of this as 200% of what we need. And your job is to get it down to half of that.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Based on what I'm reading right now, which I'm basically reading for the first time. You can just delete stuff. It's like, why would we need the row count? Just delete word row count and done. Change the listing of 7 things to say the word stats, and we'll figure out what the fuck stats is later. I think that's fine for this.

**Other**: So since it's not.

**You**: But that's just me being impatient and not giving a fuck. Because.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: I know this document is just practice.

**Other**: I am actually terrified that I'm going to have to write these for somebody else. Eventually.

**You**: Yeah, that's gonna suck.

**Other**: And so I need to, like, actually, even though this time, It doesn't matter as much. Like, at least be sort of thinking about what that would look like, which is just like. Sounds terrible. This one is a real question.

**You**: I believe we're gonna just have to. We're gonna store the creds in the import preference. S.

**Other**: Just like we already do. And they're going to be okay with that? I don't know. Security. People. Yeah. Right now it's just an import plan preference, and it's just the API token.

**You**: We'll deal with that if it's an issue and some other project. We are. We already store it in import preferences.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: For Tahoe truckees. We're not doing any.

**Other**: I know. Yeah. So I'm going to delete this because I don't promise we're storing it somewhere else.

**You**: Thing. Delete.

**Other**: Okay? I think I. I have no comments. Then I felt good about what I did, and we don't need to talk about it. The other thing, just in general about these is like. How hard do we want to think about the edge cases and things? Because in some cases, like, there's a lot of stuff spewed here that we don't need to think that hard about. But in some cases, there were things that it was like. It might be worth considering. Like, do we. I. I had the thought that it might be worth like, just having it have it taking the time to think about what its list of edge cases in case there were things that we hadn't thought about. And I don't know, again, like, this project just needs to effing get done, so maybe not. And oh, well. And I'm less scared than I used to be that it gets implemented at a scale that we can't handle. An ED case here and there, but. Answ. Er, my own question. Here. We don't. Care about that. So anyway, I don't know, like, I kind of. Maybe it just is. Like, if you are going to go through this when and actually go through it as you develop, like, and you're going to see them, that's good enough. At this point. Like I don't think there's anything in there so interesting that we need to talk about it, but there are things that we need to remember.

**You**: So you're saying that some of these. You're thinking maybe we need to think and add to the edge cases or.

**Other**: No, no. I'm thinking it brought up some good points.

**You**: Yeah. Got it.

**Other**: And maybe we don't have a plan for handling all of them. I don't know. I don't think we need to spend hours going through and discussing it or anything. And if you're going to, like, skim those at some point as you develop, that's good enough for me.

**You**: Yeah. I will. Yeah. I will.

**Other**: Okay? Okay? Where I thought something needed to be thought about harder. It's the beginning. I started putting comments, and I was like, I can't think about every edge case right now. Like, we just either we need to have a plan for talking about them or knowing that you're going to see them. So I will ignore them for now. Photo privacy. Controls. There's nothing I. That we're going to do, right?

**You**: It's if you have access to the student, you can see a photo.

**Other**: You can see the photo, right? Yeah. Okay. We can. Remove that one. Too.

**You**: And then the. The date range. I still. We should make a decision on this. I think maybe we should talk about it. The product meeting, frankly.

**Other**: About terms. We said. Okay?

**You**: I don't have a plan for terms. I'm planning to do nothing in phase one here.

**Other**: Right. Nothing different than what we already do.

**You**: That's my plan right now. Because I haven't heard anything. Better come up with a better idea. Like you could try. And fudge their. We're not doing concurrent terms, so we can't just import term dates. Period.

**Other**: Right. I think we should just do what we do now.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: It's again, not going to be at the scale and we don't know enough once we get to understand if their schools do things differently or if they are pretty much all falling into a certain category where they do things a certain way.

**You**: Correct. Exactly. Yep, that's my thought.

**Other**: We can do something later.

**You**: Exactly.

**Other**: I think it's totally fine to do nothing with terms and marking periods right now. It just means there's one more click for whoever is running the setup. My only concern with it, with not doing anything with it. Could be addressed with a simple Apply this term to all schools. Apply these term dates to all schools or whatever. Because the reason why I was nervous about wanting to have this is like, I'm thinking about a 30 school district, and your first impression of is that you have to go enter 60 term dates.

**You**: Totally. And that'll be an enhancement project.

**Other**: And you hate it. So, yeah, it would be much simpler to just have an enhancement to copy terms or copy term dates. And that would fix that right up. Okay? Cool. I think I have enough information now, just more context and whatnot, to be able to make this only 10 things we need to talk about.

**You**: Yeah, that's. That's. That would be perfect. Delete liberally something. Delete liberally stuff that's like. That sounds good, but it's not quite how we do it. And I don't want to sign my name on. Nobody will notice it's fucking missing. There is nobody with even.5% of our understanding of this document that will ever work at Aries.

**Other**: And then I can come to you with 10 things. Right. Right. I know. And I. Yep. And if we do something more than is on here, that's better than doing less.

**You**: They're going to be thrilled because I'm going to deliver this integration.

**Other**: Okay? I think I can take this, come to you with 10 questions or some reasonable number, and then we can be done. And then I guess the next step is. I ask? Alicia, are we done, or do you need me to make this some sort of a spreadsheet, in which case I can have Claude extrapolate the actual requirements.

**You**: Yeah. Yeah, let me do that. Or bring me in if you're doing that. I have a thing for it.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: That saves you some time. But, yeah, I'd say let's try and do it without the spreadsheet first. Let's see if we get away with it.

**Other**: Yeah, I'm going to just. I'm going to send it to Alicia as is once it's done, and be like, is this okay, or do you want us to.

**You**: And I would just. We'll turn your spreadsheet when it's closer to done. If anything.

**Other**: Yeah. Yes. Yeah, that was going to be my final step. Once a week, discuss and make changes. Do you want to read through the SAML sections and the stuff I don't understand? I was afraid to delete anything from there because I just don't know enough about that.

**You**: Sure. Samuel and what else?

**Other**: How about I add, I'll tell you once I've done with my questions because I don't want us both making changes at the same time. And also, I don't remember right now.

**You**: Okay? That's fine.

**Other**: So I'll have my 10 questions, and then I'll have two sections with line numbers that you should read through and delete what you want to delete.

**You**: Okay. We're late to product.

**Other**: Because I just.

**You**: I'll see you over there.

**Other**: Yep.
