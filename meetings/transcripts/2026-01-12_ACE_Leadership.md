## Transcript

**Other**: And districts out. I've been at multiple organizations about the size of Aries in terms of revenue. And I've been able to see a lot of growth. I've got a lot of experience working. With superintendents and with districts and with curriculum leaders with IT and CTOs, and you name it. All up and down. Student services, MTSS leaders, et cetera. So all up and down education. I think there's a huge opportunity with where you guys are at. I was at a similar startup that was founder based that got bought out by pe. So a lot of the same struggles and things that you're going through, I've seen that before. It's exciting times. I mean, there's a lot to look forward to for the future with where the company can go and getting the backing of Francisco Partners. I think they're an amazing firm to be partnered with. My experience is that these PEs, they're not going to let us be not successful. I mean, we will be successful, and I can be very confident of that. And I feel that the product and what Aries provides to customers is amazing. With the amount of retention that this company has, I mean, it's only. Not a downhill, easy kind of a thing to do. But as you bring on new products, build new products, you bring on your partnerships, you bring on new opportunities through acquisition and M and A. There's just a lot of really good things that happen. And with that comes change. That's the thing is the one thing that will stay constant is change. It's just one of those things that. It's unfortunate. As you grow, changes do occur, and they happen, but at the same time, you're building on the foundation of those that are here before. So you give gratitude and thanks to those who've helped get the company to this bar. And now it's up to. Brent leadership team, including myself, to help steer the course to new heights in different directions. And sometimes that means things will look a little different. Things will change a little different. You know, hopefully you try to maintain the culture, you know, the good company culture that you've built here. And I know from my perspective, that's one of the things that really attracted me to Aries was the company culture and the ability to work with great people with an awesome mission to help kids and you know, the whole JumpRope acquisition was really excited to be, you know, trying to impact student success and move the needle. You know, when you start adding acquisitions like that, Then, you know, it's. It's only going to benefit the districts and the schools that you serve. So. So I'm super excited to be here and, you know, can't wait to meet everybody. And I know over the course of working with everyone, you know, I'll get an opportunity to work with. You at some point, hopefully, and, you know, just really looking forward to helping move the mission forward and, you know, staying focused on what areas was all about. And that's the kids and the schools and, you know, making sure that our customers are delighted with, you know, the software and the solutions that, you know, we provide. So. Thanks for this opportunity. Yeah, it's great. It's great to have John here, particularly here in the office this week. We've got the sales kickoff over the next two days, Tuesday, Wednesday, with the leadership of Matt and Charity and Natasha leading the way. So very timely opportunity to meet these folks in person. Everyone I think but one remote that will be participating. So hopefully you'll be able to hit the ground running and get to know each other very quickly. Any questions for Jon? Welcome. Yeah, welcome. Super exciting. Pleasure to meet you. Great. Well, I'll open the floor again. You know, obviously, we're going to go through today's agenda, but if there's any other comments, questions, concerns, Feel free to send them my way. Andrea's way, Jonathan's way. Jonathan obviously off today. I'm not here with us, but celebrating his daughter's birthday today, but back tomorrow. And we're available for anyone that wants to chat. I'll be meeting with Ellen and Randy and James after this meeting, and we're going to touch base and see if some of the shock has worn off from this morning. And look at how we drive this thing forward. Thanks, brent. The things that we're really leaning on to right now are the three Cs. The competency, caring, and conviction. And Brent's message that he sent out last Friday talked about that, too. Using the three Cs and helping your teams through this change. Our employees here at Aries are really passionate about our mission. And we still have a really strong culture, and it's up to us to keep that going, to make sure that that passion stays there. We still have a really, really strong culture, and these are ways that you can help maintain that here at Aries. So the competency is how we run the business. We communicate clearly, we set expectations at the enterprise level, they're the ones making the decisions. At the ELT have a predictable execution in solving root cause issues. In caring, I think, is our really strong point here at Aries and building trust and culture, we're transparent with our communication. We're creating that safety and a accountability. Coaching and development and cross functional. We work together cross functionally. And the conviction to lead with courage. So decisive action, address conflict directly, uphold standards even when it's unpopular, and create long term value over comfort. And I think that's probably the area that we are still working on developing is that conviction area that we need to really lean into. And help us. So. The two strong things that are going to really help us with leading through these changes is being consistent. So as leaders, we are the source of information, right? You're the ones communicating with your teams. They're looking to us to get the information from about what's going on at the company. And how you speak about this change shapes. How they more than all hands message. We may have an all hands about these changes. But what's really most important is what we're saying to our teams about the change. And creating that one message, and then we all have consistent messaging to our teams. And this is kind of just taken out from Brent's message on Friday. I thought the message that we are presenting to our teams. So as leaders, we're expected to reinforce that same message consistently. We acknowledge that change can feel uncomfortable. But we stick to cut the facts and don't speculate. Be calm, measured, professional and respectful and escalate concerns. What we should not do is speculate about performance. Personal opinions or assumptions. Attribute it to pe pressure. Predict that you think might happen in the future?

**You**: I'm going to send you upstairs if you can't play over here.

**Other**: Quarterly rocks our company values and escalating concerns. So Brian's here, and he's offered to come to meetings and just ask if you need additional support. So what your team need right now is under competency, just having clear goals. So we've set our goals. We're going to still state the course there. And that you stick to all of the data driven, using your data to help you make your choices. Announcements like this can really disrupt your team and the work that they're doing. And so try and make things normal as possible and just being there, being empathetic and listening to your team, allowing that space for them to voice their concerns. And then conviction part. So confident doing is important and it still matters. And that our company goals are strong. We believe in what we've set up for ourselves. And that we have our quarterly box that we are to meet in. When you use the three C's protected trust or have reduced anxiety, preserved momentum. And we're going to reinforce our culture. I'm looking at through the lens of the three. Needs to be done where you need help with what? Things are going to get stalled because of these changes with your team. So think about if your team is directly impacted by the changes. To get through and ask the ELP team for help. With the caring part. What do our teams need? Hear from us and feel this week to stay confident. So that means that we need to have some one on ones and meet with teams later today or early this week. To talk about and check in with how they're feeling. Talk about what the plan is. And without maybe a new VP on the product, kind of what the plan is in the meantime. And with conviction. For this week. What? Are there things that we need to decide on that we may be afraid to approach or address this week? Think about that. And ask for help. I know Brent will be checking in. The ELT team is here to help guide through these changes. So please feel free to ask. And as a leader. These are the messaging. These are ways to message to your team. We need to own the message and the communication. And the company is really relying on having this consistency. And not to speculate or bring in personal opinions or judgments into the conversations. And so. The link to this deck that. That was. A little bit more about the three Cs and kind of diving deep into it. What questions or concerns do you have? Or maybe we can talk about, if you're a stock, about how to talk to your teams this week. Before we transition into the questions. Probably just a follow on statement. Everything that we just saw you present. Thank you for doing that, Nika. Ultimately, the most important takeaway out of all this is what we call leaders intent. So, as leaders, this is what we're expected at ERs. So as we and Margie spoke about the concerns around maintaining or rebuilding trust, I would say that it's an all hands leadership responsibility. It's all of our responsibility to be able to live through these three Cs or lead through those three Cs to maintain and continue to build the trust that we've already built with our peers and the people that report. Yeah, I absolutely agree, Jim. C is another up. There's change. That's something that these three Cs become important. Another seed to throw in. There is consistency across them. It's easy to think, as Nika pointed out, we're really good about caring, but at times we're not always the best about conviction. And it's similar to we talked about radical candor in the past. And the way that that book structures it is, it's that cross section of caring personally and challenging directly, and that's that accountability aspect. So similarly.

**You**: Pretty good.

**Other**: Our teams to do the same. In some instances, we're going to encourage people to ask questions just like we are here. In some instances, you won't hear from people, but you'll know deep down that those people have some lingering concerns. So just encourage with that leadership intent. That you apply that actively, even when sometimes folks are afraid to speak up or, you know, there's something else on their mind that they maybe don't want to share, as in a large form. And just to reiterate, as we close out last year, These three Cs do become a metric that we evaluate ourselves on and that we will be evaluating our leaders on this group on moving forward. Certainly not the review cycle that we're going through right now, but for next year and beyond, We really intend to keep these top of mind as an extra lens for our leaders in particular because it is important for guiding our teams underneath us. Any thoughts from anyone. For our team specifically. Being able to use the roadmap as our North Star, along with these three Cs, will be helpful. That's something tangible that we can go back to. Not sure if that would be helpful for any other divisions. I feel like it would be because there's some shared responsibility there. That would be something else I would throw into the mix here. Forget the roadmap. And that's something practical that we can dive into, focus on. Absolutely. Well, again, we have some big priorities in front of us, and I want to take a moment again to celebrate. What we did we've already accomplished in the last year. We've referenced a year ago. Was a big change for us. This. Gathering as a leadership team in the new year. And we know from even from what Andrea shared about. Metrics in terms of our 110% completion across our top level. And bottom level average. We did an awesome job in 2025. With everyone that's here and with the leaders that are departing us. So we have a lot of appreciation for the work that was put in. Just a lot of great embracing of change from everyone's teams.

**You**: Hi, sweet. Guy. Show me. Pretty. Good. Alexa, play baby boots. Hey, Siri, play.

**Other**: And we're just going to build on that and take that to the next level in 2026 and beyond. So, again, really appreciate all the work that was put into 2025. And looking forward to springboarding. Into the future from here. Changes growth, and growth has change. The name of the game. Nika, you shared recently about review period opening up. Obviously. We've talked a little bit about that in other regards. But we have the 110% bonus metric to apply for everyone. 109. Go ahead. 109 okay, sorry. Around it to a nice brand number, but obviously, you know, we need your three C's applied here and getting those reviews done in a timely fashion. So we can move forward with. Rewarding all those books with a great performance. Yeah. So, employee self reflections are due next Monday, and then your performance reviews for your team members will be due January 30th. That should include your one on one meetings with your team members as well. So share the review and culture amp when you're ready for them to read it. With them and have a one on one conversation to go through what was written in the review. Can I just add something there? Yeah. If you're giving someone a five, that needs to be discussed with your manager first and the executive team before that's given. Yeah. So before you share the review, make sure that's been discussed with your vp. Because that does need approval. Yeah. As we mentioned earlier last year, Four. Is the new five. Now five is the four exceeds expectations and five is promotion ready. That's kind of a new, a new number. We know folks are still going to pick some. Getting used to that. Reporting to you. For those that have been here a while. But, you know, the percentage bonus now applies at the four level that they were used to at the five before. Plus the multiplier across our company performance. So it actually is higher than the path. It's a great thing to share. Yeah, yeah. I'm getting. I have been getting a lot of questions about when the performance bonus is with the paid out. I don't know if Andrea, you can share a little bit more about the timing. It's February at the earliest. Okay. It's still going to be quarter one. Yeah, it'll definitely be quarter one, but okay. We've got a board meeting next week in which we'll be asking for final budget approval, so certainty on all that as well. And we also have to be like, mostly 99% is closed with 2025 before we can do that.

**You**: I don't think it's going to work even as I plug it in for a while. Try that.

**Other**: Cool. Well, again, I appreciate everyone's buy in. Engagement today. We have change ahead of us. We have change. We're in the midst of it. Again. Lean into the discomfort. Reach out to your managers. The three C's top of mind as commitments towards path for our goals. Both 26 goals. Before we give everyone. So quiet today. Understandable. Bring it on. Figure Chris, we need to give John three days before I start peppering with questions about timing and delivery of things for the sales team. So, like, he's got until Friday, and then it'll be. Our process says this, what do you think? And he'll be like, who is she and why? Is she talking to me? We'll just be quiet. That would be the pmo. John. No, alicia. Very well. It's the poo. There's more than just me. Sorry. The pmo. I'm an office. Of one. And John will be forwarding a lot of messages my way. What is she talking about? Well, thank you again, everyone. Thanks. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Jen, welcome. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Take care. Thanks. Jean.
