## Transcript

**Other**: Before. Hey, good morning, jesse. Hi. Jesse, you remember allison. Yeah.

**You**: Hey, guys. I do? Yeah, we spoke last year.

**Other**: I'm just sharing out with Alice in the breakdown of how the tech peanuts Joseph the day before the Thursday I actually make them without wait pretty much a table that has banners and has a lot of our swag and has some of her informationals and some of the handouts. People come in and learn a little bit more they can take back to their school. On Thursday and then I plan to be there Friday morning a little bit before 7:30 is my goal, just so that I can be around to be there for the booth and just make sure that we have everything set up for our session and make sure that can participate in breakfast, because they host breakfast too. That helps us breakfast and lunch, so I will be there earlier. There is no obligation for you to be there that early. As I shared before, for our purposes, you have been with us all day on that Friday. So if your school or anyone ask, you've been with us, you've been there. If you get there a little bit past breakfast or whatever you can, that's Not a problem. Just make sure that when you come in, you pick up your badge, because your badge lets other like it has a QR code that's unique to you. So if you do visit other booths or if you are participating in other sessions, you can both get CTLE credits if you went that route and they can recognize you in your school, and they also recognize that you're part of our session, too. So don't forget to pick up your badge and you're ready to the registration. So you're all set to go. The badge is usually on the first floor, so when you come into the main entrance of Brooklyn Tech, you'll see the space all set up at the main hall and the way they've done it historically is that their students, student volunteers will help you and will guide you to different floors and will guide you to the elevators, and we'll set you where you need to be. Our session as of this morning. I looked at the agenda. So on the homepage for this event, the agenda shares out that our session is at 2:15 in the afternoon, which is the last session of the last workshops of the day. Start at 2:15. This is the last one and it's at 2:15. They told us what room, I think we're in the fifth. Let me share my screen with you. Give me one second. So this is us here. We're in five and two on the fifth floor. I hope that our booth is also on the same floor. So it's really easy to go from the booth to the room, which was the expectation last year. But last minute they made some changes agenda and while we were physically at the session, they moved our room to the auditorium. So things are subject to change. It is a live school building. There will be students. It's Regents Week for high schools, so students are coming in and out as needed to take their exams. But it's an active building, so they will move us accordingly. Hopefully they keep us on the fifth floor. And our booth is on the fifth floor. I hope. I will know for sure on Thursday what floor we're on, and I'll text you guys to let you know. But that's the meats and potatoes of the day. The day wraps up around 3:30, which is the end of the sessions. Our session ends at 3:00. I think because it's 45 minutes. It ends at 3:00. The official time frame of a conference ends at 3:30 and from 3 to 3:30, they do a raffle. So certainly, if you want to stay close for the raffle, do that. There's some really good prizes that each of the sponsors and each of the vendors give out. We are giving out Amazon, so that's going to be contribution. So if you want to stick around, you certainly can. If you want to get out, that's also no problem. You have family obligations. And super grateful that you're making accommodations to be with us. So I know that if you need to leave early after the session, By all means, go ahead. Any questions for me? I guess my only question is if I do come early. I know you had mentioned that I could participate just because I've never been there. Do I just find these places and walk in? Yeah. Find whatever sessions you like. The agenda itself. Let me scroll to the top so that you can see the top of this page. The agenda itself tells you who's host, like who's doing the presentation. Quick, short bio of who they are. And then it also tells you the details of the session so that you. Can click on the hyperlink and open it up. Here's the official website. For the events. This is where you registered. And then the agenda is right here. So it gives you the full layout of what the. So if you want to peruse it before arriving this way, if you want to mark off some of the ones you want to attend, certainly there is no limitations to how many you can attend. Okay, answer as many sessions as you like. The only limit is the room capacity. So if they have like a smaller room that only accommodates 20 people versus a large accommodates 50 people, that's really the only limitation in the space. Usually get a nice classroom size for us. And like I said last year, they gave us a full auditorium, so we have really good sessions. Jesse, do you. Want.

**You**: Yeah. Hey. I was thinking we could Talk through the PowerPoint really quick and just come up with a general strategy. So, in my experience, Allison, there could be anywhere from 5 to 25 people in the session. It's arranged. It could be more. It's usually not.

**Other**: Sure.

**You**: So with that size. It's usually okay to be fairly casual. I'm a fairly casual presenter. I don't read slides. I riff off of them the way I like to do it. But you can come back with a different strategy if you'd like. Is so looking through. I'll just start with three minutes of introducing JumpRope and pass it to you for three minutes of talking about your school mention. How you use JumpRope at a high level a little bit. So that gets us through slide six, basically. I don't need to prepare any of that because I'll do the first little bit and toss the ball to you to get us through slide six. And then there's three major categories here. We're going to talk about what we call the hybrid grade book. I know you're using standards based. Standards based is our core. From a business perspective, we're trying to make people aware that we also do traditional grading because I'm going to talk about both, all those we care most about. We also want other schools to know that they can use JumpRope if they're not.

**Other**: Sunday, right?

**You**: So Hybrid Gradebook. I will go over some features that we like to highlight. And then I'm going to pass it to you. And you've got a couple slides. This will probably do. Like a casual back and forth when your slide comes up and say, Allison, you want to talk about how you guys have set up your standard mastery levels and just give you a minute. Before I keep plowing through. Is this sound okay to you? So far, this general strategy? That passing it back and forth.

**Other**: Yeah, definitely.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: For sure.

**You**: So we'll just use the slides to decide who's talking. If it's one of our slides, I'll pick it up. And if it come, one of yours comes up. I'll lobby a softball. So, hybrid gradebook. Then we go into kind of attendance and messaging. You guys use our messaging, product and attendance. Right. You must use attendance. Yeah.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Again, I'll highlight some of the features. Messaging is relatively new for us, so there's a good chance most people in the room haven't heard about it. And then the final feature is class grades, which is kind of that finalization and submit to ag process. So each of those is really just. I'll highlight some features, and when your slide comes up, I'll give you the chance. A minute per slide. Roughly, and I'm sure we'll get caught in some of them with questions. It's an hour long, Yamaris. 45 minutes. That's perfect then, because that'll give us time for Q and A again. There's not like a formal outcome here. JumpRope goal is to make people more aware of our product and our features and give them a chance to ask questions and to highlight the way your school is using it.

**Other**: 45 minutes.

**You**: If you have things you want to share and communicate. There's almost nothing you could say that's wrong. I think.

**Other**: Okay, attention. Is there anything that I was missing in the slides that I worked on, or did I cover what you guys were looking for?

**You**: It's great.

**Other**: Yeah. Okay, good. All right.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: Yeah. Like Jesse said, he's very casual on his presentation style. Right. It's more of a conversation than this. Very formalized, structured. I like to have the slide deck. Not because I need you guys to work off of it, but it's kind of like a guiding post. This way you can just have your agenda, and if you need to come back to it, Because oftentimes when people in the audience ask questions, it kind of takes conversation a different route. So just give you an opportunity to spirit back into it and anchor it into that slide deck. There's oftentimes where he will go right into a live demo and we'll log in into JumpRope and show.

**You**: That's true. I might do that. I'll be driving it for my computer. For that reason, I may or may not. When it's a big group, I usually don't do the demo, but when there's small group and there's specific questions, I find it's useful.

**Other**: Just.

**You**: But.

**Other**: Definitely.

**You**: Then we'll have a chance to hang out at the booth. That day before the presentation and we can have any last minute chats at that point if needed. But I feel good about it.

**Other**: Okay? I'm excited. Thank you for inviting me.

**You**: Yeah. Thank you for coming. We're not allowed to present without a partner involved. And we've overused a few of our schools. We're like, who else is using all these new features? And your name came up, so I'm glad you're willing and able.

**Other**: Yeah, well, your school definitely has been in the pilot program for messaging. You guys took the pilot program for class grades and you took the pilot program for multigrating period view. So you guys have used a lot of our stuff while it's still in a testing phase and then give us amazing feedback. So we wanted to make sure that we highlight what you guys are doing at the school and, like, the level of success. But also, I don't want you to lie about it either. If there's challenges that you've had. Please do not feel like you have to reserve that. Share your challenges. Because the point of having our co presenter be someone at the school is because you get to speak to exactly the challenges that you face every day. Right. I don't sit in the classroom. I don't work with the teachers. I don't work with my administration directly. But you do. And you can speak to some of the challenges they have come up. Maybe some of the ways that you found that you worked around it, maybe some of the things you're still facing. So certainly bring it up during the presentation too. I'd rather that it be real and feel in a box.

**You**: For sure.

**Other**: All right, cool. Do you have any questions for me for Jesse? Anything you need from Oz to support you as we come into the new week. I don't think so. Okay, cool. I will touch base with you the week of definitely on Thursday. I'll send you a quick email just to make sure that we're still good to go and everything is answer any last minute questions that might come up or share any updates that I may have as I continue to coordinate for here, for this event, and then we will see you on Friday. So you have my cell number. Let me give you my number. Yeah, I don't have that to get in contact with me. We're in the building. Depending on their wifi, I mean, their wifi tends to be pretty good. Depending on their wifi, I might not get your message immediately, so just send me a text or call me up, okay? 917856. 5900. Okay? This way. If you need me, just send me a quick text. I'll tell you what floor I'm in, where to go, whatever. This should be signs along the way, and like I said, student volunteers to guide you. But just good to go to the. Where are you, man? Okay, cool. So whenever you're ready. Just send me a text, Just let me know, like, hey, this is me. And then I can your number on my phone too. And then I'll text you on Thursday after I set up the booth and everything. And I'll tell you what floor we're on. This way. As soon as you get in, you know where to find us. Sounds good. Jesse, Any final thoughts? Any last minute pieces?

**You**: No. I'm good to go. Thanks, guys.

**Other**: Awesome. Well, I told you it was really quick, really brief. Thank you for joining me earlier. This way we could just jump right in. Have a fantastic day. All right. Thanks, guys. Bye.

**You**: Thanks, yamash. Thanks, allison.
