# Meeting 2026-01-16_13-15-11

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Template**: 1-on-1
**Participants**: Unknown

## Summary
Discussion about how to manage and share technical requirements documentation. The team is debating whether to keep it in the current AI-friendly format or convert to a spreadsheet, and when to involve Alicia for format decisions.

## Key Points
- Current tech requirements document was built heavily with AI assistance
- There's a version control concern if the document exists in multiple formats
- The document needs to eventually go into Jira but that's structured completely differently
- Alicia has no expected format for tech requirements currently
- One person considers the tech requirements done since October
- Git sync issues are causing confusion about what's been committed

## Decisions
- Will send the document to Alicia as-is to get her feedback on format
- Will wait for Alicia's input before investing in a repeatable conversion process
- The current format will remain source of truth while still making AI-assisted changes

## Risks & Concerns
- Version control problems if document exists in both AI format and spreadsheet
- Aries team will need to add their own content and format is unknown
- Current format may not be acceptable for formal approval/submission
- Some requirement numbers may be inconsistent after recent changes
- Business requirements may have changed since document was generated

## Full Transcript
A CSV or an Excel file, maybe where any basically though, what we need to avoid is a version control problem between two formats. Yeah, that's why I was like, are we ready to get it out of here? And then I can work with the side. Well, and there's I don't know if there's really a way to get all of this into a spreadsheet. Like I don't want all of it. I want something to come and take just. I get it, but then you can't edit the spreadsheet. Alicia ag agrees and not just And AI loses access to it. Yeah. And I don't know. And I was like, all right, well, I don't think what you're expecting is what we have. Well just you know, just we we we we we we we we we we we can wait to be told that if we want. Yeah, and I think possibly yeah, like it's probably not worth investing in a repeatable process because they are eventually going to come up with a And if this still lives here, fine. If we want someone else to see this. And she'll understand the source of truth problem. And that can see past this. And then my question to you is then which one is the source of truth. Yeah. And then our format, we get to choose what the format is. You know, I just I doubt this will be an acceptable format because they're not going to have other people able to produce exactly this or whatever. You know, I I have to assume it's they're gonna want it to be a spreadsheet type thing like the rest, if when they choose a permanent format. And we're thinking I Anyway, I c I need to go meet with the Maris right now. Are we Aries is gonna have to add some of their own stuff at some point. Sure. Right. And they're probably and I have no idea what theirs is going to look like. So I guess maybe it's for Alicia to reconcile. Like if we're comfortable saying we're done and I'm done. As is. Because it was the one that they published. Because yeah, that makes no sense at all. Yeah. Yeah. But But I don't give a shit about the spreadsheet, so that's up to you. But I guess I mean one option would be instead of a spreadsheet, we just put these things in But if we don't know what we need to continually deal with, we need to find out or decide. By mistake. Excel spreadsheet for me. Gets changed, it runs a script that right now it turns the release notes into HTML automatically and pushes it to SharePoint. Guess what she's gonna want, I guess. How far from done do you think we are? I I I I imagine, right? Yeah. I I I I I I I I I I I I think so. I just but at some point we need to be done with it and not changing it, and then that doesn't matter as much. I I don't even know what this looks like in jury yet. Like I know. I I know. And that's why I if I I was thinking for me it would be a lot easier to see just the lists of the tech requirements and not all this other crap, so that I could decide, you know. I can definitely get this into a spreadsheet form. It's just either gonna have huge cells, like if it's a row per technical requirement. I can just download it and make it a I could do something similar that publishes this as I don't I don't I don't care. I don't have that inclination right now. I don't know what the ten steps are intuitively anymore, so I don't know. I had Claude pull everything and make merge it in so that without me pushing anything, right? So I could do that again. But then I did I was afraid to push up these things that I don't know what they are. And you made changes to tech requirements or you I have not done anything. I'm just trying I was trying merely to see the changes. Just tell Claude to reset you to be Origin. I just I'm I'm I I I I I I I I I I fear that a giant Jira card becomes like unreasonable unreadable, you know what I mean? Like if we're but I I I I don't have enough familiarity with like using Jira for something enormous. I just had it do uh. I mean if if if you So I would run that command it gave you in the terminal or tell it to do it or whatever. I mean it could all go. I need to see the left side. I put it in general, but I should do what I want and make my just afraid that I'm like I that and that means it probably could be Oops. I think a spreadsheet. We need a spreadsheet because it's just too hard to find anything or reference anything in here. Yeah. You know. Okay. So do you want to do that or do you want me to try to I have a pretty decent way to do that. Um I think it's done then. I've been done with it since October in my head. Okay, yeah. I mean I think it's done. That's why I'm like. This is me filling in boxes so that I can do my job. Right. Not staying in my job. Yeah. That's why I was like, are we ready to just be done and I would I would like to make a repeatable process if this is something we're gonna have to continually deal with. I would say hey, we used AI heavily to build this. This is the format it comes in in. We're still making changes to it, so we're trying to keep it in this format so that we can keep it iterating until it's close to complete. I'm I'm trying not to think ten steps ahead because I'm just not yet comfortable with the like. If I could look at just that to get it by itself, it would be a lot easier for me to work with if I'm going to put it into Jira manually. If I'm not, and we're gonna try to have AI do it, we need to know exactly what we want. If you install one drive. If you need it and you can decide what the source of truth is, I can script converting this to a spreadsheet. I could also invest in a much more robust, repeatable process that we can use for future tech requirements and I can share with other people in the company, but it feels a little early for that. So I would rather Alicia tell us that it needs to be a spreadsheet, frankly, and slow roll. Um but It is. It isn't for me. It won't let me poll because it's of a conflict, right? And so I got Claude to do that. Yesterday I got everything up to date. It's too hard to find anything. Jira and then I don't care that I can't read this. Later this afternoon, probably. Let me see what this just gave me here. Let's make sure that Like Like if she does it, then we don't have any link between Like it can it's just Like we have to be a hundred percent done. Like we're not touch touching this again. Yeah. Like what more? Like you know. Maybe there's a way to structure it so that it's not I mean I would lean more towards a story per category. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mostly. My best thought for that is like we have a Okay, I made a spreadsheet. I'm gonna send to you right now. Okay, good to know. Yeah, and like I truly don't know I I'm not gonna spend a lot of time worrying about how this looks down the road because I don't even know what they're gonna be looking for. So I'm more concerned about it being usable for us. Okay. Well I can make a CSV and Okay, that's fine. I um you want to send something to Alicia today. Ninety percent of what I wanted to know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. But it's got, you know, huge cells that aren't wrapping and stuff, but that's a row per tech requirement. Okay. I I don't know. We could anticipate it. We could c if if if if if if if if if if we wanna come in looking polished so that she just stamps things, that's a different strategy. I I Okay. I mean you don't have to yet if you don't feel the need for one, I can I'll send this to Alicia to look at as is and just see what she says. Um but I need to I can just download it as like something she can read, right? Surely. Or have Claude do it. I think I can just make this. I don't know how to send this to her in a way she can use it. Okay. I think I'd like to do is Okay. J just the idea that it loses access and then once you're going to be able to do it. Okay. So if you're you're comfortable with all that I mean obviously this must this as far as I can tell is already on origin. So I have no fine. Th there's no way you can delete anything I did. One of which is actually mine. One way. I don't know. Or is it going to live in here and need to match anything external, the TRD. Pasting the shit below it. Preview looks really ugly, but it opens fine in Excel. Really hard to work with with AI. It's really annoying. Release notes. Right, so that's what I was saying is like before we spent time on it. Right. Right. And I my inclination is we don't need to try and be smarter than it. We can wait until we're out. Right. Maybe she wants to take this and whatever they give her from their end and put it into a spreadsheet. Right. Yeah. See what happens here. So So So I think there's a little less pressure on that defect escape rate. That was Jason's horse. So it gave me a list of the commits that it says I have outstanding, but these are like the ones that are So like you're what you're saying is we can ha set it up so that this is the source of truth and it Some of it looked so I was going to reconcile it with that. I already did that. You did. Okay. Teams is That is a repeatable process. That just means nobody can edit it but you or me. That the I'm that's not considering like That yeah, as a human. That's because I I completely agree with you that we probably do, but That's it. The only thing that I was afraid is that some of the numbers might be screwed up now, and I was gonna go through and review that. Tell Claude to do it real quick. Claude, can you make sure all the numbers are consistent? It's okay if we skip one here or there when it's been removed, but we need them to be cons, you know, consecutive. At least Yeah, and I don't know how long it as nothing I don't know that I'm 100% sure nothing changed in the business requirements since this was generated, but I don't think so. The other way to do it is put it the way you want and tell her this is what it is. It's already the way I want, but I don't care. The way I've been doing these um Then I don't care what she does with it. Then the cells are gonna have This is like every commit to this branch from the last however long. Todo Uh no, she I didn't say can we just use this? No, because I don't think I can just use this. Uh-huh. Uh. Um Um Um Um Um Um Um it needs to get into Jura though at some point, so that's structured completely differently. Um, or we decide it's time to be done with this and we put it in a spreadsheet, and then the spreadsheet is the source of truth. Updates. We'll just go from one fucked up Git state to another at worst. Well do you do that's did you ask it? What further things do you anticipate doing with AI with this? Like having it create the Jira stuff? Are you expecting to have it What happens when you click the triple dot and just do a poll? Uh that's what I just did that and it it it it it it it it it it it nothing. I mean it Will she Will she be able to open it? With a format they want, or we can say we made a format and maybe she'll just adopt it. Would you agree that when we share it beyond our development team it needs to be in Excel format? If so, we need to come up with a way to convert between them and see what she says. She might say, Oh let me do it. Well that's that's what she probably will say. But we don't really want her to, right? Like Yeah, I mean I I I'm inclined to just Yeah, I mean I can convert it to something. Well, I just mean why not give her the file as is. Yeah, and I don't even know what the Yeah, like I don't know. Like Alicia said, she has no format for this right now. No, no expected format. Yeah, that's I was like, at some point are we ever going is this always going to be the source of truth, I guess was more is my I don't have an answer to that. Uh if we're gonna use AI to work with it, it needs to be in this format. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I gotta bounce. Later, thank you. Yeah. Okay, well I I I can make it a spreadsheet if you want. It's not gonna be right this minute. I mean I could too, I'm sure. I just you had said that maybe you wanted to be involved in that. Yeah. Okay. That'll probably fit. As long as it's okay, I'm sure I can get it to do that. I just was like I I I don't know. I this happens to me twice a day. Git tells me shit that it doesn't make any sense. And I Yeah. Right. Yeah, and I'm I'm done if you're comfortable with it. Yeah. That's one way to do it. Or You are more than welcome to tell me what to do with it. You can go into SharePoint and any folder in SharePoint you can bring into your OneDrive, and then it's just a folder on your You can run a script that turns this into CSV, but it's not gonna have You can't really edit a spreadsheet directly with AI. You could try that thing I just pasted for you. an issue per business requirement. Right. But I'm gonna do everything in one branch. At least. Yeah. Like practically speaking, it these build on each other and it doesn't make sense to do in isolation. as in this is already optimal for me. because we wouldn't ever be able to reconcile with this, you know what I mean? computer that syncs like Google Drive would kind of back in the day. So I made a thing that went I have certain folders that are published deleting things I shouldn't, but it seems like all this is already on the origin branch, so I just don't understand. Why the S. edge cases and stuff, you see what I mean? Yeah, no, I'm not sure. I don't care about all that right now. I just wanted to see it like the tech requirements. Then yeah, I don't even know what they expect all to have included in tech requirements. Do they even need all this? Probably not. So I will ask. eight bullet points in them for acceptance criteria and if we need it to look like we did more or some shit. Um that's I'm kinda leaving that up to you. is I wrote a s so okay. level of Alicia. Yeah, that's fine. metrics down the road. new boss, new priorities, defect rate, he's probably gonna come and be like, that defect rate was bullshit. not care what formats it's in because we don't need to change anything anymore. Well um of here and into something else. Like planning to ever get this out. put it into a readable file, but I spreadsheet, um um when I change when I add the release notes or edit them. It's pretty cool. you know, the acceptance criteria and the edge case crap unless we just sc c c c c c c c c c cram it into cells, I guess. I guess we could. Uh-huh. Yeah, I think. Like I think if we have to submit this for approval, this is not gonna fly.
