## Transcript

**Other**: Hey, jesse.

**You**: Hey. Interesting morning.

**Other**: So who read you in?

**You**: Well, I just found out five minutes ago. Basically. Although my teams gave me some signals that as somebody has had to remove people from tech. When they were let go. I was like, I've been made the owner of my one on one with Jason. So teams let me know a few hours ago, but I didn't know anything for sure until Justin gave me a heads up five minutes ago.

**Other**: Wait. Justin gave you a heads up five minutes ago.

**You**: He just got off an ELT and he asked if you should join. I don't know, you guys.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: In.

**Other**: That looks like the email just went out. Half hour ago from Brent.

**You**: Okay. Yeah, I've seen that. I'm behind on my email.

**Other**: Yep. Now I got. The DM at like 7 in the morning from Andrea. Hey, I need to talk to you. I've got a meeting on your calendar at 8:15. That was like, oh, shoot, what's going on? So I'm, like, looking at ProsperOps. Did something spike in the bill? Did. I'm, like, digging through. Aws. No, everything looks fine. She dropped that bum. At least you got an invite. Or a message from Andrea. I got a message from Brent. He's like, hey, can we meet at 8? 10? I'm like, this could end. Or this can only mean two things. Being fired or my boss is being fired. Well, yeah. No, it's when you see Nika's name on the invite with you, that's when you know. Anyway. Well, I feel bad for people in HR for that reason. It's like anytime they get added to your.

**You**: Yeah, it's ominous. Their name is Ominous by default.

**Other**: I. Know. It's bad. It's probably, like, one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Is just letting someone go.

**You**: Yeah, those are the worst couple days of my life, too. And especially when you like them.

**Other**: Yeah. Especially when you like them. Okay, well, I don't know if Randy's joining us, but I'm going to try and get a meeting going for our teams, at least the product and the dev. And I'll see if I can invite Brent because they're all freaking out. Who is. My team. I just got off the phone with Jan and Tracy and Tamika, and they're like, is this what we're going to Every January, this is going to happen?

**You**: You're tim.

**Other**: And I didn't realize that last January. Yes. Was when there's something very. It was a little more.

**You**: Was it last january? When? Right after.

**Other**: It was a larger house cleaning effort last January. This is just a leadership evolution. Right. But they don't know that, right? Because that was. At first, it was Cam in June or July. And then it was more. I totally understand. I mean, I totally empathize with them. It's hard, especially with all the news, everything rendez old companies, just letting massive amounts of people go. It's hard. It's always in their feed and on LinkedIn, right? It is. Yep. Did you finish your call? Ellen, the call you were going to make. No, I postponed it because my team was freaking. I got on the phone with Andrea, and then I started getting his messages from everyone, like, what's going on? And I'm like, okay, Andrea, I gotta go. Randy, I don't know if you saw my message. Would you consider having, like, a joint team meeting or you'd rather just meet with the. I'm all for it. Yeah, let me do. I'll invite you, and then you want to invite everybody. I can do. We want to ask Brent to join. Or. Okay, let me ask him if he's. Is this like a division wide? Like, let's discuss the email meeting. So you guys have. Can I make a small suggestion? I would try to do it in small groups. So there's a little more opportunity to be transparent emotionally. Because if you do it in a big group and you invite the CEO, it's going to be unless you need to do an orchestrated message or something, like you want to project a certain thing. But if you want to handle the emotional impact of the psychology, part of it. I would suggest small teams, kind of. Or small groups. My two cents. It's easy for me to say because my entire team is three here poor people. I only had one. Fast, and I wanted to be respectful of boundaries. So I just figured I'll put something out there for the developers, and if we need, we could always make it bigger if we needed. Okay, that's fine. I'll just schedule one for product. I'm probably going to do it at noon, then. I'm going to plagiarize your email, Randy. I'm just going to. Yeah. Go for a similar message to my team. The wheel already round. We don't need to make it more round.

**You**: There's not somebody replacing him immediately. There's a search going on.

**Other**: Officially, there's a search still going on. The inside baseball is there's an offer made. To somebody.

**You**: All right.

**Other**: And that is all of the inside baseball I'm privy to.

**You**: That's all I knew too, is there was an offer. It was out but not signed. But it could be. According to Justin, who's on the ELT meetings, it could be, like, up to a month. We don't know. Before something gets resolved.

**Other**: Andrea told me that the minimum. Possible date that anyone new starts is 30 days from now. She also let me know that this person get them. Comes with years of experience in AI development. And.

**You**: How many years can you really have an experience in AI development? 3.

**Other**: Well, I guess it depends at where.

**You**: Yeah, three.

**Other**: At what stage of the journey you're talking about.

**You**: True. There's been ML stuff forever. Yeah.

**Other**: ML has been a thing for a long time, and LLMs are just the latest application of ML. We just called it AI because some emergent properties lent itself to that.

**You**: But. They're an order of magnitude more impactful, I would say, than previous AI at least in the way I work. Either way. I'm sure that. Right. Questions?

**Other**: Yeah, and tons and tons of AWS platform knowledge and expertise. Which that's exciting to me.

**You**: That would be. Nice.

**Other**: Because we've never had that in the leadership level. That high up.

**You**: Well, what are we supposed to do? Our jobs, I guess.

**Other**: Sticking to the roadmap. Romance to north star. The vision is. I'm, like, taking a. I might actually literally use waking hours. To step away and zoom way out mentally for a while. And kind of. Reacquaint myself with the vision. And kind of understand. Or to my best I can. That I can. I'm going to try to understand what is necessary. To get there. Kind of just to be open to whatever possibilities or changes the new person is going to want to make. And maybe think through. If a and then think through whether my gaps. What are my team's gaps? More than I already have under the focus that we had under JSON. But I didn't get my scope a bit. To me like suddenly the possibilities became endless in front of me. With this news. Just by necessity, a leader is going to focus you in on things. But when they're not there anymore, now suddenly. A lot. More opportunities. Are presented. And then probably do a little walk and talk with Jason, just call. Them. I'm grateful.

**You**: How long was he at Aries? Three or four years. Or less. Two years.

**Other**: Two and a half somewhere around there.

**You**: This all feels weird from my perspective because I had barely formed relationships with Jen and Jason. I don't have an emotional hit, really, but it still feels. A little chaotic. But I understand where they're coming from for sure.

**Other**: So two years ago, the same thing sort of happened. Paper for only like two or three years, but had been at the company since he was 17, and. His late 40s. He was the heir apparent from the founder, and that's why he even had shares in the company.

**You**: Interesting.

**Other**: And he was a very different character. It was his way or the highway. Ultimately. He ran aries. For the most determined. It's product, vision. It's where it's going, everything. And made himself. The only decision maker, I think, is the best way to put that. No decision was made without him making it, which paralyzed everyone else, meant everyone else had to go to him for permission or question to do anything. And now he's at a competitor.

**You**: Is it? Which one? Apollo.

**Other**: Apollo.

**You**: No.

**Other**: Yeah. Apollo k12.

**You**: Are they actually growing in California? Apollo. Do you guys know, or are they targeting another state?

**Other**: I don't know. No, but their marketing is custom tailored to target Aries districts. Yeah, things like. Don't you finally want a longitudinal database? Don't you want to know that a rollover doesn't require a call to support? Like all these little things. They're just targeting Aries districts because they know how our systems work. Because that guy is responsible for the architectural debt that we have.

**You**: Yeah, it's stinking.

**Other**: I always want to ask the questions, like who would want to go to the guy who built the debt that you're bragging about not having? But anyway, that's just me. So last time, we did just the Jesse fii. We're not here to talk about them. At least not yet. But last time, I did a competitor analysis. Every now and then, I just look through and see what's out there. Is approved by the jpa as an approved cis for california school district. I don't think there are school districts that have their cyst, but I think there are smaller charter schools that may already be live on nurses. In fact, one of the schools we were looking at. That one was in California, actually. That one was, I think, Arizona. They were actively. Looking for the Open to help them with Apollo SIS implementation. No, no.

**You**: Have you run into focus in your competitor analyses?

**Other**: Oh, yeah. They just stole one of our district or two of the. There might have been two, actually.

**You**: For the messenger product. We're evaluating their messaging features pretty closely because they include it in their base price. And we feel like it needs to be at least that good if we're going to charge for it.

**Other**: Apple Valley, I think, was the one that just wanted to focus. Yeah. Apple Valley's got an administration that. Cantankerous. I think. Is polite as I can be.

**You**: The road. Here.

**Other**: Okay, well, Jesse, I need to talk to you about all the SBG stuff, because I know you've been meeting with Tamika, you've been meeting with Jenny. What do you need from me? Just to get us through this week.

**You**: Yeah.

**Other**: Are you waiting for? I posted a message and I said, here's everything I to give you. Do you need anything else from me? And I didn't hear back, so I assume you're good.

**You**: Are you talking about on locate the thread you're talking about, is it the one that's got, like, 10 people that isn't named that? Jenny?

**Other**: Now. I'm talking about the R1 to 4 division leadership. I tagged you and I said we have a JumpRope communications goal to get us through producing a.

**You**: Oh, yeah.

**Other**: So producing aid means we haven't approved brd. We have a groomed backlog, we have a TRD sign off and acceptance. And we have a prototype sign off and acceptance, whatever that means.

**You**: So for messenger, Justin is owning the BRD creation. I am just consulting with him. My responsibility will formally kick in when the BRD is done. And approved.

**Other**: Is that Excel spreadsheet, that brd, or there's actually going to be a BRD for that? Because we need to.

**You**: Which Excel spreadsheet.

**Other**: Okay, well, I copied the Excel spreadsheet and not message.

**You**: Because. I'm trying to find the. Second.

**Other**: If you just look for JumpRope communications in R124. I just need to know for that Excel spreadsheet what is the dependency on Aries and where do you need us so we can create those stories on our side and we can plan.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: Because we have to groom them too, because backlog of groomed user stories for us as well.

**You**: Yeah. My understanding is there's no dependency on Aries.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: The needs will be to understand. So we're adding features to JumpRope existing messaging product first. And then when it's ready. We'll wire up the attendance notification configuration from the sys to drive the messaging features in our product somehow. But that's a Phase two thing.

**Other**: If you could just respond in that thread, I just tagged you and I said, this is the thread I'm talking about. So that way at least we have the history.

**You**: Yeah. Thank you.

**Other**: Of what's happening.

**You**: I'm just glancing at this exact spreadsheet here to make sure it's what I last. I don't have access to that spreadsheet. So it's not what I lost.

**Other**: Or you don't have access, I'd suggestions, so you may need to.

**You**: I'll bug Justin about it. Okay?

**Other**: Okay. And then as far as the SVG goes, if I understand it correctly, there are only two user stories for two points. An API endpoint. Is that all you need from us, or is there more?

**You**: That is correct.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: So it is a read endpoint for grc, which is valid codes and. An update endpoint for grd already initialized. Class grades, and I've gotten pretty far into the details. We're actually almost done with our tech requirements, and from my perspective, it looks like Jenny. Last I heard, jenny is. Yeah. So I've met with caleb nguyen, jenny. Tamika. Somebody else was there. Who's retiring Sylvia.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: Yeah, Sylvia was there. And they said they have what they need to write their stories. And Ellen, correct me if I'm wrong. But the thing that you already calendared for the Feb. 17 release, the goal is we're just adding a tiny we're adding the GRC read to the initially, the GRD update that we had written. And that's it. None of the other stuff will be part of the phase one of this.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: There might be some things, summer or next fall if scale hits us, that we might want to tackle, but there's nothing else. On your teams. We will want to. So Jenna and I are rating technical requirements. We have a significant amount of work to do on the SBG integration. We're going to want to add. Technical requirements. From your team. To one document. So we have one technical requirements document. But I think ours is, like, 90% of it. And it sounded like Jenny was going to. Write. If I understood the roles right, Jenny would do. The part on her side. Or maybe she's just writing the stories. I don't know the difference between those two things.

**Other**: I. Think she will just be writing the stories. And just keep in mind, Sylvia, her last day is this Friday, so she's retiring and Jenny will be taking over some of that.

**You**: Right.

**Other**: Okay? Randy, when we have our call with Brent Today at 3, we need to talk about API V5. I have huge concerns, especially with that. And I don't know that Jennifer's not here and Jason's not here, and Jennifer was driving that whole vendor portal for APIs, and Jason was going to talk to her. That goal is completely in the limbo. Can I make a suggestion? Yes, that we own API rock and. We drive it. We just need to do it or it's not going to happen because they don't have the technical chops to do it. What we could do is just get high level business desire as the end result and then we design the solution. And then, Bell, this is what we're going to do. Because they don't have the chops to do it. As evidenced by the timeline they laid out. They have no idea they're out of their dip. And that's fine. They shouldn't need to know that. But they do want to communicate to us. We want to monetize it, we want to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, okay? Here's what we're going to do to enable this, and here's the time that I need to do it. Yeah. And I think that's what their go to market was supposed to address. Right. That business need. And I think that go to market just needs to be further refined because from what I've seen, it's just AI generated beef and it's shouldn't be determining that for us. Way too early. And if those dates are firm for whatever reason, then we need to say. Here's three possible solutions to meet that deadline, and none of them are building ourselves. It's this company acquisition. It's this product pool of I. It's whatever this many people hire to get it done. I don't know. Here's your opportunity, Ellen, to take back some of that power. Well, no, it's necessary. Randy and I were sitting here agreeing with you a week ago when we were looking at that channel and the output of that. Thing. It was just like. And then in my one on one with Jason, I was like, hey, Ellen's about to complain to you about these things. And just so you know, I now see it, and I agree with 100% of what she's saying. I have a crystal ball. By the way, guys, if you don't know that already, I have determined that you do. So I'm going to be your best friend.

**You**: I thought maybe you read palms or cards or something, but crystal ball works.

**Other**: Yeah. I've been through too many of these acquisitions, Jesse. I don't know if you know, but you kind of start seeing a pattern after. Your third one or second one, like, okay.

**You**: We have one employee at JumpRope Jumaris who this is her fourth kind of roll up acquisition. And she's had a lot of. She's like, here's what you guys can expect because none of us. Another rest of us. The rest of us worked for JumpRope our whole career.

**Other**: We also have my husband and I, you know, that whole it. And my entire family. In fact, they're all it. Or by it, I mean, you know, the software and IT finance. Anyway. Applied Information Science. Is that what we'll call it? Yes, I guess that's what we call it. So I wish I didn't. Anyway. Okay, Anything else that we need to talk to Brenda about at 3? Because we do have his attention, and I don't know if. We're going to have another opportunity sooner. Well, rather than presenting.

**You**: What is going on at 3? Are we meeting with him like a small group? Are you talking about a big kind of division meeting?

**Other**: I think it's just Ellen and Randy, Small group.

**You**: Okay? If I don't need to be there, I don't need to be there. If I need to be there, let me know. It's not on my calendar as of now.

**Other**: I think what's happening, Jesse, is that they're divvying up the interim. Who's reporting or managing which specific department. I think Brent is managing Ellen and Randy directly.

**You**: Got it. Okay?

**Other**: My guess is Justin's going to be you for the time being. It's just a guess. And I am being managed by Andrea directly.

**You**: Money, money, money.

**Other**: Well, that's why she's got the big AWS cost optimization rock that she wants.

**You**: Stop spending so much money and she'll get off your back, James.

**Other**: To.

**You**: Just spend less.

**Other**: Don't wear the money. Or show her where it's going. To aws. Speaking of the money. Or not the money, but the roadmap for Q1. James, I have a couple of items on the roadmap that are technical for your team, but I don't think they're getting done. So I need to talk to you and I need to deprioritize it if the only thing that's technical that my team is working on right now is oidc. So the entre. I mean, you were calling it entre id, because that's what we called it initially, but really it's just General OpenID. And that's a work in progress that's on track right now to be done this guesstimating about three weeks worth of work. And Randy, I have. Jason ever got a chance to talk to you about distributed caching and pulling for weeks? For a poc this month. But if he didn't talk to you about that, then surprise. But if not. Then we need to schedule it. But Andrea is going to be pushing this thing like crazy. We need an Eagle dev. Because the delicate nature of the code and all that, and who's familiar with it. And I was thinking Tristan would be the most natural choice, since he's the most. Or he would be. Creative and see how we can make that work. I got a couple ideas. Ellen, I'll coordinate with you. So I make sure that that decision doesn't put anything else in jeopardy. This was a last minute thing, but if we could take a two week sprint, And just get a full POC done. And I'm going to pair Brandon with him during that two week window. You'll move lightning faster. Well, I don't actually think that will be true. I think it's more so that Brandon is aware of caching and how that code is structured and what's necessary to get Elasticache working. So that in the future these are related code issues and things aren't impacting your team ever again. The idea being that Brandon, since I have a developer and this is an infrastructure level. Change. I know it's a significant architectural change in the application. But my team in the future handles this stuff and handles the ongoing band, those kinds of code changes. So it's really to do the pair programming thing so that Brandon. Can come away knowing this stuff and then. Take it for the rest of the year. Okay, we need to sit down, and we need to come up with a plan for Q1 for Brandon and for Tristan, because we got to figure out who's working on the security fixes, the Big Mac. We've got a big project there. And cash staff. Everything else that's on here. One roster, 1.2. And whatever else Tristan was supposed to be working. We have the API v6, and I don't even know what this means, but it's on the innovation roadmap. Is it possible? So if you look at this thing, which I absolutely hate, especially this last. Is it possible we flip it? Then maybe it's Tristan with Brandon for, like, a couple of days. To give them the lowdown and then let Brandon complete the POC with Tristan as a backup consultant. If there's questions that come up. Let's schedule a meeting for that. That's just the three of us. Let's look at all the projects for those three. And let's see which one is. The security thing to me is a higher priority, and I'd hate to see that. Sacrifice 1 roster 1.2. It's like, who cares? But the security thing is. Yeah. Well, one roster, 1.2. Yes. I think of all the room to shift, that's probably the one. But we can only push it down so much. Our competitors have hired for more than two years. It's like we got to chip away at it and we can't just completely stop. But again, if we have to. Something's got to give. Why? Understand that? Yeah. I just need an eagle death. I can't offshore the work for Redis. We can't do that. And it is what it is. It's money. Right. And Andrea is going to push for that because what worries me ground up rebuild of the API, existing API, security issues, what that means to have the identified what they are. Do we have? I think that's the risk. Is that what that. Is that the R? But here's the thing. Do we even know what they are and are they existing? So I feel like that was somebody through that in as a talking point. That's what that screams mean. I'm not aware of security issues of the API. Other than the fact that it's a single static cert that you put into the header URL, and so you want to upgrade that to something that's OAuth compliant. Something with a temporary bearer token that's issued that expires. Just a more modern authentication process. That might be what that's referring to. Yeah, but if that's the rationale, then whatever we rebuild has to address that, right? Yeah. We don't need a V6. To. Like if that's the only rationale to your point, then we don't need a ground up rebuild. We could just put Olauth in front of our existing. Let me call it a day. That's a much simpler solution. Okay, I think that one we probably need, like, a. I think we all know that that was the only rationale, though. Well, protecting Aries IP and is the other. Yeah, I said market opportunity. Let's slide was abbreviated awkwardly. Yeah, let's talk to Brent about it today and see if that goal is still a goal, and if it is it offshore, and if it's us, then we'll figure out all the dependencies in the meantime. So what I've got is this integration job. So this is Q1, and this is. Everything that's marked for technical enhancements. This is the one that comes to mind. I think this is the Keller thing, right? This is not okay. I'm going to say move to next quarter. Honestly. Yeah. Observability of integration jobs. That will be a nice thing, but the business hasn't really told us to do that. Okay, I pushed it off. Let's see what else is here. If the business tells me that we really needed that, then we can throw it on, but right now, It's like basics. We're just addressing issues. OIDC and then with distributed caching and then re architecting the whole thing to make it cheaper to run or even touch observability and integration. I don't think I have distributed caching on the roadmap, just that's what you've called in cache. I know, but we moved it all off the roadmap. Oh, that's true. Because it was pending what Andrea was going to tell us to prioritize, and she right now. We are trying to get a poc done. Before the end of January was kind of the timeline we were looking at, if we can get it done. That was pending talking to you, Randy and Ellen for capacity of Tristan. But the idea being that. We get a working PoC of distributed caching and that whole project. With integrating support for parameter store and a multi tenant like configuration on the web server side. All in one go. And then getting an idea of the work left ahead of us so we could scope out a full project. Not just the development and QA part, but all the way to deployment and going live on that infrastructure. And sizing the cost of Elasticache or Redis or whatever and understanding what the TCO is going to be. And this meeting happened last. Thursday, so I just haven't had a chance to. So there are eight features right now for ncache, we've got NCACHE implementation, so all the testing, monitoring. Yeah, I don't want to say. It. We'll probably keep some of this phasing and stuff. But there's going to be additional components that get added to the scope. So I'm going to come up with a grand scope. That incorporates distributed caching implementation as well as the other two items I mentioned that are just AWS cloud config stuff. It will boost our security footing considerably. Okay. Can you do me a favor? So I'm going to add a feature. And I'm going to call it. What should we call it? Poc and cache poc. Not in cache. We're going to call it distributed caching. Okay, what rent should we put it under? I don't know if you guys can. I'm going to put it in Q1 for now because we don't know and we have to figure this out. So do we have a special project for her to track time? I don't use ado that much beyond the Kanban. What's a good one? Do we need to add a new specialty project? Call it. Everything that we use is infra. Structural systems. It's probably fine. Okay? So I'm going to add a link to this in Q1. What we need to do is we need to figure out who's going to do this work. And then I'll make sure and I'll try to merge. The in cache. Project with the two other link features that we already created and approved. For AWS Secrets Manager and parameter store support within the CIS code base. Just add whatever user stories you need to this feature. I'm not able to do that quite so. I will do my best, but I think me doing user stories is maybe premature. Other than really high level because I need these experts to solution it. But. What I usually do is have, like, I tell them, this is what we're trying to do. This is how. Fast. We're trying to do it. And then create a solution and then create your own work items based on it. That's kind of usually what. My approach to these guys. Okay. And then in our next Sprint planning session, bring it into the. By the way, you're invited to those meetings, James, because that's where we talk about developer capacity distribution. He's going to work. On what? Whose help we need. If you don't mind, come to those meetings. At least you can multitask until we need you there on Tuesday before we start a new sprint. I don't have anything on my calendar. Are you sure I'm invited? Or maybe I was at one time in the past. I'm not so sure anymore. I know I never product and definitely the only stand up ever anything is my own. That's on my calendar. I assume no other calendar items. Related to. That topic. Is it, like, every week or maybe Saturday? It's every other week. They kind of go with the spring cadence. I'm going to forward this to you. And then I'll make sure you get. The series as well. This is just the event for next one. Hey, Randy. Shank reached out to Matt and they are scheduling their AWS transform. Activities already. Okay? Just saw the email threads come through.

**You**: Before we hop off, I do have three quick things. I don't want to interrupt this, but I want to just grab maybe three minutes. I want to throw out some questions. Let me know when it's a good time.

**Other**: Okay?

**You**: Okay? James, I talked to you last week. Andrea's bugging me about integrating our AWS accounts. Let's just make sure we have a common line here. You're waiting on some savings plan analysis or some new contract before we know what the savings will be.

**Other**: Yes. So casey andrews. And andrea knows who casey is. She's met with casey directly. Casey Andrews is our account manager over there. And. She is running the math essentially, of different scenarios to make sure that we execute on the right thing in the right direction. Because part of. The complexity is I asked what? Is it appropriate or is it advantageous to renegotiate or enterprise contract early? I think we've got another year on it. And we've already blown through our commit like we're on track to crush it. It was a five year commit for like 15 million or something. And we made quick work of that. Or no, it was less than that. I don't remember anyway. Bringing on your accounts adds to our burn down. So it kind of creates, like, a new baseline that's higher, where we could edge into a higher percentage discount tier. But then adding you also increases our enterprise support payment.

**You**: Although for what it's worth, about 10% of my spend is non enterprise support. We do baseline support through them, which I think is 8 or 10%. So that might go away. So that we could add that to the math, potentially.

**Other**: Or just gets added in two hours, I think is what will happen.

**You**: It might. But if we're opting into Enterprise support, I don't know if we have to pay.

**Other**: Yeah, so they have. There's like a. There's a metric, there's a. There's a floor.

**You**: Okay, I'll let you figure that out. That I have no idea.

**Other**: Yeah, yeah. There's a floor on there end that is like. That's why it's like, we need to make sure this makes financial sense to do.

**You**: Well, and at the best case.

**Other**: And if it doesn't or it's break even, Andrea will want to know that it's break even. But at some point and then I have to look at the less obvious savings like the cost of managing multiple orgs versus putting it all under one and having one set of tools and.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: Like the management, streamline management, things like that.

**You**: Y. Eah. And even the best case we're looking at. 500 to 1,000 in savings a month. It's not a huge amount. Here because our bill is only 10 or 11amonth.

**Other**: Yeah.

**You**: So.

**Other**: Your annual spend is a quarter of my monthly spend.

**You**: I've been trying to call her off. And you pay James a nice so much more than you're going to save from this. So pay attention to how much of our time it's taking before you squeeze us. But anyway. Okay, that's what I just need to tell her the same thing you're telling her and so that we buy the time and I'll trust you to tell me when it's time to make any changes.

**Other**: Yeah, I'm holding off on the technical part of it because.

**You**: Second thing.

**Other**: That one to me is the way Riskier thing to do is to start dismantling your org and causing a problem.

**You**: I. Agree. Yeah. That's going to be slow and careful, and we just need the finance people off our backs so we can do that at our own pace. I think I agree.

**Other**: But the biggest. Yeah, the biggest reason I put you in, so I could apply Prospero Ops to your guys spend, which might shave off even more so getting your effective savings rate from like 10% up to say, 18 or something like that.

**You**: Sure? Yeah. I've never really optimized. Cool. Okay? Just so you know, I'm saying James has it under control, but I'm waiting on him.

**Other**: Yeah. Talk to james. I'm out. James is handling it. He's more up to date on it. And I also. So the other advantage to getting you guys in is. Then you can contact Enterprise support directly. Right now. You can't.

**You**: Cool.

**Other**: But I already our technical manager. Yeah, but you guys. Are small enough like, just. Just let me know.

**You**: Yeah. I haven't talked to or support people forever. Okay? That's what I needed for that. Moving on.

**Other**: I'll help you directly through them.

**You**: I have been told to be interviewing candidates for two positions remote through Global Logic, and I've conducted one such interview already. I'm working with someone named Anker. Do you guys know him? At global logic, okay?

**Other**: Yep. Yep.

**You**: As far as I know, the budget approval will come towards the end of the month. And that person wouldn't come on for another month or two, probably, I guess. I was going to ask Jason this today.

**Other**: Don't give them dates is my suggestion.

**You**: Okay. Why?

**Other**: Because I gave. I was given a date of last year, and that came and went. And I think I've lost the guy I was gonna pick pending.

**You**: That's my worry is these people might have 10 other things demanding them. Should I even be spending time interviewing people until I know I have the budget or not?

**Other**: I think you can. It's just. It might change who he targets or brings to you.

**You**: Interest. Ing.

**Other**: So if you say something like it might be end of February, that I'm able to actually say yes on dates, That might open the pool to like. Well, I know this guy over here. His contract ends in the beginning of February. So he'll. He will be available at that time versus needing someone today.

**You**: Okay, that makes sense.

**Other**: He has thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

**You**: I know it's crazy.

**Other**: In his pool.

**You**: Do you think that Jason's departure is going to impact that at all? Does Anchor know Jason and care about that, or should I just pretend it?

**Other**: Anchor was introduced to Aries in July. So he's been here a very short time. About. About the same amount of time as you. Little bit shorter. So? I don't think so.

**You**: All right. I think that gives me what I need. For that. Thank you. Randy we had discussed. Caleb. I know he was on the OE 2.0 team and there was some concern. He goes AI adoption and then we throw out the idea of him working on the SBG integration. Do I know who I'm working with? Dev Wise? Because I've mostly talked to Nguyen, but Caleb was on a couple of these calls. Too.

**Other**: I think we're going to stick with Wynn for consistency because Caleb is turning a bit of a corner. On that.

**You**: Okay?

**Other**: And I think there's going to be some benefit to keeping him with that team for right now, especially with all the other disruption. I think keeping things as they are right now is probably the best move, at least for the next month.

**You**: Yep. Okay? And so, presumably now Jenny will write stories, assign them to Nguyen. And I'll reach out to me if he needs me for anything. Is that how that works?

**Other**: Yeah. Yeah.

**You**: Cool. All right.

**Other**: I'll keep Caleb involved for context so he could at least have some familiarity. That way we don't have a single point of failure with.

**You**: Okay? And I might bug Caleb for I have a couple saml questions that have cropped up that he seems like a good person to ask. Is it okay with you if I just bug him on teams? They're quick questions. Probably.

**Other**: Absolutely.

**You**: Okay? Cool. And then. You guys. What's that?

**Other**: Questions around Samuel because Brandon also might be pretty.

**You**: Brandon. Okay, I'll go. Caleb first. He seemed to be knowledgeable. Somebody else too. Okay.

**Other**: Decent resource on that one. Oh, he is for sure.

**You**: And then my last question. You guys mentioning, like, a division meeting today or maybe small group meetings to discuss Jason's departure? Do I need to be involved in that? From your perspective, I'm kind of indifferent. I don't know most of the people yet. Or have much to say. But I can play any role you want. If you guys want me involved.

**Other**: Right on. I know for me, you know, my invite was focused on the team. I tried to get it earlier in the day to accommodate the east coast folks. That are working off the east coast time zone. 4:00. So it's a late night. That said, I'll invite you, and if you want to be there, we would love to have you just, you know, for posterity. But, like, if. If you feel like it's going to be impactful and you got other stuff to do, go for it. I just didn't want to leave anyone out.

**You**: Okay? Yeah, that's totally fine. And. What is ace? Leadership. I've never been told what that is, but things have popped up in my teams. Is that something I need to know about?

**Other**: What I think. So airy center of excellence. And they had various centers of excellence. So this one is focused on leadership. So it's usually executive directors.

**You**: Got it.

**Other**: And a leadership. Oh, there's an ace cybersecurity. I am about to propose adding a new one. At some point this year, but I'm probably going to hold off until we have our new. Chief.

**You**: Cool.

**Other**: For operational excellence. From a sas point of view at least. We have a data management. It's the edm. It's the Architecture Council. Supposed to be ace. Yes, it predates the Ace terminology, but it was like the original prototype. Thing across will probably be under Ace as well, because they canceled it. But they didn't. Reevaluate and add a new one. But yes, Jesse attended that one. That's where they share a lot of the leadership updates, presentations. Changes. Yeah. Randy flexes with his PowerPoint skills.

**You**: Nice. Yeah. The problem is, it's right during dinner time for me. Let's see what I can do.

**Other**: Fully understand. Tell him to make it earlier. Oh, you're talking about Randy's thing.

**You**: All right. That is all I needed. Thank you, guys.

**Other**: Okay? And then you'll send an invite for the 7:00pm one today. For epam. Oh, for Ethan. Yeah. Yeah, it's most likely going to be moved to 8 because it's still 5 in the morning for them. For a couple guys. We're dealing with a 10 to 11 hour difference. Yeah, bellarus and. Us at the moment. Belarus? I don't know.

**You**: I don't know if officially it is or not. Probably depends on what news source you read.

**Other**: I. Don't know. We're very. When we were very anti Ukrainian invasion. They were very pro. Well, they're president is on the Russia side. Yes, he was like a very friendly to Moscow. Anyway, I just. I was like, okay. I just didn't expect Belarus to be the answer to that question. Yeah.

**You**: Most of their developers were in Poland, it sounded like, but there were some Belarusians on the call.

**Other**: I wonder if billy. Yeah. I think there used to be a lot of Ukrainians because the previous company we used, Exodal and Nuxadl, was like Eastern Europe, lots of Ukraine. And then right when the war started, they started moving like, yeah, well, some. There's one to war and.

**You**: Yeah, what they told us. They relocated them? Yeah, they moved them all to Poland. Yeah, it's a bunch of them. And are making drones and stuff. Probably. Now that's what I would be doing. Drone warfare software. All right.

**Other**: Tried a hat their grids and infrastructure systems.

**You**: Yeah. Or defensive drone. Yeah, defensive hacking.

**Other**: Offensive cybersecurity is what I would be doing.

**You**: I always thought being in the digital service would be a fascinating job. For those of us who spent our careers defending against security issues in the cloud. That's a discussion for another day.

**Other**: The other interesting. I know it's not for today, but my sister in law is the director of QA at a software company and she said a lot of their contractors were in Ukraine and people were stealing, like getting into their houses, stealing their computers and their equipment. And then asking for ransom because they knew that.

**You**: Jason had a pretty good relationship with him, though, is what it sounded like. He'd used him in the past. Prior.

**Other**: All right.

**You**: Thanks, guys.

**Other**: See y'all later. Bye.
