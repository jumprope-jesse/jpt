# Meeting 2026-01-16_11-00-30

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Template**: product-leadership
**Participants**: Unknown

## Summary
Leadership discussion about AI tool budgets, AWS marketplace billing strategy, and approving an AI-focused quarter for development. Key decisions around consolidating AI tool spend, avoiding AWS marketplace for new subscriptions, and establishing measurement frameworks for AI effectiveness.

## Key Points
- AI budget approved for trial quarter - ceiling of $1-2K/month for tools like Claude and Cursor
- AWS marketplace spend should be minimized to avoid inflating commitment baseline before contract renewal
- Company is significantly over AWS commitment ($4.9M actual vs $2.4M committed)
- Blackstone/Anthropic offering 40% discounts for FP portfolio companies - webinar scheduled
- AI tools being positioned as replacement for offshore developers with better predictability
- Weekly check-ins with Randy established for AI initiative oversight

## Decisions
- Approved AI tool budget trial for one quarter with Randy oversight
- Do not add new subscriptions to AWS marketplace - use direct billing instead
- Move Jira/Atlassian off AWS marketplace when feasible
- Pursue SMS cost reduction vendor evaluation
- Develop framework with Alicia to measure AI effectiveness across organization

## Risks & Concerns
- AWS commitment baseline inflation - renewing too late means higher baseline from recent spend
- AI tool costs can escalate quickly - need tight monitoring and overcommunication if exceeding estimates
- No clear reporting structure defined for Jesse currently
- Company described as 'far behind the eight ball' on AI adoption

## Full Transcript
'Cause I was like well let me just try and make it twenty percent of what the developer would A new VP of product or whatever type of CTO. CTO. Got it. That's interesting. So you're shifting both those VP roles up to C level. A year ago. Got it. A year. It's subscription. Seven or eight grand a year, I think. That's fine. Okay. If you have to do three, it's five. Just be cautious of that. Okay. But I imagine if you have a contract that big to renew that you're Well, yeah, the only other thing we're gonna do is move Jira at Lassian to there, but that's AWS serves. I don't want to increase our com sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp spend on AWS. So that'll in the past I smuggling. Doubling our commitment right now. Okay. And we and All that. Someone who's a bit more. Speaking freely, the product division needed a change of leadership to be effective. I could see that from day five, probably. Totally. Um Alright, I gotta run. Alright, hey, sorry. Just got a phone. Alright. And move it off at the US. Yeah, let's do that. Okay. Um, I'm not gonna promise it g there's some engineering effort involved, but not a ton, I don't think. So let me evaluate it. And that's under Aries. And then let me just make sure s I understand this. So there is a s a a search or an offer out for a And we are gonna let you move forward with just an AI budget on it. And you have to go run through the email, there's a link in it to register. Anything personal or direct. As long as it doesn't like derail what you're doing. Yeah. If it if it's not the best timing for it and you want to just get through what you gotta get through for the quarter first, that's fine too. I'll pursue it. I'll evaluate it and we'll see where you'll end. At all. Before it spiked up because they measure your baseline on the previous six months. So now we're kinda f Interesting. Um so you have does that mean you Brandy just gave me a But it's saves some money and I it I I I I I I I I I I honestly have more I can predict my output better in this world than if I had offshore developers. The one thing is like figure out a way to measure how successful it is. Yeah, that's important, right? And like maybe put some thought into that. Do not have Do you see the email? I think Brent copied you on it. From from from from from from from from from from from Brent or Doing pretty well, thanks. What can I do for ya? ELT. And you have you use Claude, right? Or are you using something else? Pretty much Claude, yeah. There's it's a little more subtle than that, but yeah. Uh you you you were copying it on the email yesterday. Good morning. Good morning. Um first of all, has anyone reached out to you like Brent or Jonathan about Jason? No, um I've talked to the other directors, we've had a couple of meetings, but nobody nobody gave me any Gosh, I don't know. W what is my title? How will I? I I I I gotcha. Okay, that's fine. Cause I I I in the early days in jump rope, I sp I I I I I'm not gonna say smuggled. I used to say smuggled my some of my AI in my AWS bill, like a hundred bucks a month or something, because it was easy and secure. But I will stop doing that for sure. I will go all in on. I don't know. I if there's no the only incentive was to consolidate billing, and if there's a disincentive to reduce spend, we just keep it how it is. We weren't saving any money shifting to AWS. I might I previously used something called Cursor, which has been a few hundred dollars a month. Um I wonder how that gets built. I wonder one thing I need to know is I'll reach out if somebody bugs me up. It's fine. Um I we we we we we we we we we we actually chatted about it the other day that one of them should be reaching out to you soon. Um just to check in. But I did speak to them about your proposal. Okay. I'm doing it the following week. Um That's great. And I the the the the the the the the the the the one thing I would say to you is I threw out those thousand and two thousand as very round numbers as like the most I would need, I think. I'm not spending a lot of time on them'cause I don't even know. Some Grand Here or Jonathan will end up doing it. Okay. Or J uh honestly it'll probably be Justin. That's also awkward'cause your buddies I well If it's not material, I don't care. It's like it is a two hundred bucks a month it's really an I hate it. It's an annoying one. No, I'm like if it's like twenty grand. No. If they would like me to do a further reflection. Is your license under Ares? It's not just an AI tool, but that's the main cost of it. It's a development tool in general. That I think I can shrink to It's very likely to come in under that, although It's way less awkward than it used to be. We just skipped them. Anyway, if I I filled mine out and I spent about 20 minutes on it total, I did not give it away. Jason was surprised, but that that's okay. I I didn't have a strong personal relationship. Was it really a surprise? In the existential sense, no. Yeah. Um Like it's like code is per Like the Canada is has has been a CTO at a pretty large company. Like there's so many tools out there. It's just like some of them can get really expensive. Like Claude, I imagine can get very expensive. So like what he was saying, it's best to like start with some of those tools and then figure out how to move over to some of the less expensive tools later. Yeah. Okay, I'll uh I'll check out that webinar. I'm not seeing an invite to anything in Thropping. It's an email. Okay. Made a change there. Um Make sure that you're paying attention to it. And if you see it like whoops, I underestimated this, just overcommunicate that. That I need to know like right away if you're Maybe this is too heavyweight, we could start later, but what if I started something with Alicia and a a project, if you will, that's like how do we measure AI's effectiveness? Because to be honest, all the people talking at conferences saying they 10x themselves, you gotta have a rigorous way to measure that. You can make yourself sound good to your investors. Easy. Alicia would be great to be helping with that, I think. We could develop a framework, start with me and sp, you know, consult with Randy, uh a way that we can Me because Fosswise and Randy. Much smaller. Like My boss might show up on a meeting that she's late for any second. My other job. But we can start the conversation, but I'm gonna have to bounce if uh she pops in. New product development and No. Okay. Okay. Uh however, there's one caveat here. Okay. Um Okay. Yeah, so I I'm gonna send you this note from like the EdTech conference that we had where the CEO um of Civitas Okay. Yep. Cool. On that note I recently I'll just Really measure. Six months. Sixty bucks a month to just use the dev tools and go all in on So I don't want to put anything else on AWS. So and then yeah again on the budget I I was just throwing out round round numbers. So that's that any like questions on that? I mean my only thing is I I'm as you know I'm comfortable working without direct supervision. I'm not clear who is my supervisor. I'm filling out end of your reflections. So, yeah. Talk to you later. That's fine. And I'll I'll I I I'll talk with Randy and try and get it all through the The same clod billing. Yeah. Just be cautious of the cost. There's a meeting with Blackstone on Anthropic because they're giving discounts for FP Port Cos for um whatever it is. Token uh what is it called? T T T T T T T T T Tokens, probably Tokens. Yeah. Um Brandy has already sent an application for us to get the discounts, but I want it's a it's a one hour webinar. You can either do it next week or the following week. Okay. There's another one for that too. When you log into it, there's one the 30th to the the following week too. Board meeting. Yeah, that's right. Okay. W whichever one's easier for you. Awesome. Also, you know what, actually, if you could do the next week one and tell me if it's a waste of my damn time. Yeah. They're a lower level. They're saying forty percent. I'll believe it when I see it, but but drop it. This is Jesse. This is kinda informal right now. I had a call from a company that can probably reduce our SMS costs by thirty or forty percent. Those are ceilings, I would say. Three grand a month. To develop. Two methods to get AI. One of them is cloud code that that Two or three grand off of AWS a month for us and drop it by Uh Uh we have an offer out to somebody. We're waiting to hear back from them, but hoping that we'll have somebody in pretty soon. Um someone who's a little more level headed and experienced with AI development in particular, and just you know Um Um I don't know if he's gonna accept though. I don't we have another candidate. We have a a a a a a a a a a a few, but we have a couple backups. Oh shit. Oh god, I gotta take this. Um it has nothing they don't partner with Parent Square. It's just Parents Square happens to be a customer. Anyway, it I I didn't get a formal proposal, so I'd have to ask for them to do a quote. I I will. And that that would shift. Um like do you put that on like your bracks or does it get billed to the company? I would imagine it just gets gets billed to us. So I can feel it's somehow monitor that. Yeah, I think Randy has a business or enterprise like overview of it. Okay, I'll ask I'll ask Randy about that if we get like an invoice that shows who. So the there's another option that you can keep in the back of your mind is that it um Um so I've been using Um then Unless you need more of a budget than you can then you gotta make it happen. I'm just kidding. We We don't have any. It depends because we get a discount. You don't on the marketplace. Um the marketplace. Yeah, I gotta tell him that. He doesn't understand that. So Yeah, I only have one marketplace subscription. I have to do at three AWS as far as I know. We just go back to the old plan if we need to. We need this crap done, and if you think and honestly, we're so far behind the eight ball as an organization with AI. So like shit, if you could figure stuff out fast, working on your own and teach it to other people. Yep. Amazing. I'm gonna try. I'm excited by this. Like I said, it's a Renaissance and I'm a Renaissance man. So let me let me participate here. And then I chatted with Randy about it just to get like his thoughts on it, and he had the same sentiments as you about an offshore resource is not a solution for a single point of failure. And I absolutely agree with you. So our thought is let's try this out for a quarter and see how it goes. Exactly. We can always change our mind if it's not doing traction. We can go back to Global Logic. They have a constant pool of availability. So Yeah, and he confirmed like what you had said, how like these tools really force you to do the documentation. So that is your backup. Yep. Right? I think so. Um, and then what else did he say? He was also of the same mind where like actually if you properly implement these tools, like it will replace the need for offshore developers. That's the idea. Always. Yep. So that's interesting because I didn't chatting. I didn't poison him at all. I didn't even mention this to Randy. So if he's a good idea, he seemed like excited about it when I was like talking through it. So cool. I think I think um cool. I want you guys meeting weekly. Yeah, that I think that's great. I haven't had a thought partner, and he's the other I I think he's a great thought partner for me to figure this out. Yeah, he's he's Randy's great. He's like super level headed, and I think he's like super energized by the AI stuff, too. So I just think you you probably have it you're in a position where you can actually play with it and do it, and he's not, so he's probably jealous. Yeah, I've got to be. He's gonna be pretty jealous of you, but like hopefully whatever you're able to put together there is something that can be repeatable with other areas of the business. I love it. I I think this is exciting. It it's not if it doesn't work out for some reason. Wednesday. Uh yeah, Wednesday is fine. Well that was a total fuck up, so I'm gonna apologize for all of us. I think'cause like you and I had talked like Jennifer. Well, obviously we're trying to capture some cost savings next year, right? Our contract renews next year, but you can early renew, but they won't let you early renew at anything less than your baseline. So we what should have happened. What your initial thoughts on how we can measure that and let's chat about that. How what if I what if I When we were trying to hit a commitment, we needed to run it through AWS. But now we are so far over our commitment that the lady was like, hey Which is Yeah, I might get Yeah, if it's something that's like a relatively easy lift to make that switch, then great. But if not, don't let it derail your corner. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty much. Yeah, previously they Yeah, that would be better. Um I'm not in a huge rush on this one. It's next Monday, okay? Or next week sometime. Yeah, there's a link down there. Like we decided we wanted to send you Yeah, which are pretty Yeah. Yeah. If you think that's sealing Yeah. Okay. I am registering for the twenty third. It works with my calendar, so I'll see how that goes. And yeah, if it's if it's a waste of your time, I'll reach out and let you know. You can also bill it through AWS. Um You need to have weekly one on ones with Randy to go over it because and the main reason and Brandy's not your boss. click in and for a couple of months because it'll take work. Um cost or something, but I really don't know. I don't know where I'm gonna land. expecting to not next year, no. Okay. If we run out of the contract, we can drop it. Okay. So you're trying to say. If we wanted to early renew and capture a bigger discount. Because right now we only commit to two point four million in a year. We're at four point nine. Wow. gave like an AI tool update thing and just something to think about. We'll send this little point to you. Okay. infrastructure service. It's the one that Parent Square uses, by the way. is we should have renewed it uh well tip in order to I really shouldn't be telling you this but they base it off your last six months so when you're thinking about renewing six months prior pull every marketplace bill out of AWS um per user count per month, and there's a hundred and fifty dollar level and then a two hundred dollar level. But once you're yeah, so I have a one fifty one. I will see I might be able to fit the majority of my work into that. But once you start to hit maxes, your choices are prior to when you want to renew, pull all marketplace spend out of AWS. She like gave me that you have with Claude does come with like a certain amount. Correct. And if you use it and it renews a little bit daily, a little bit weekly, they meter it out in a complicated way. It's hard to it's hard to measure. the ROI on it. Yeah, and I said to Randy, I'm like, I feel like jump rope in particular, because you're not fully integrated with Ares is the perfect guinea pig here. Yep. I I I I I I I I I I I I really think it's a cool opportunity to see if this really has legs and I'm excited by it. This is this is yeah it's exciting side experiment. But yeah, I agree. I'm gonna work I'm gonna reach out to I'll tell you what, I'll first check in with Randy next week and we'll get our heads together. If he thinks that developing a company wide framework is a good idea, I'll start tiptoeing into that with Alicia. If not I can do something lighter weight but I'll put some thought up front into how to tell if it's working and report that to the clear. That actually is something. If any like subscriptions come up that you normally put through A A A A A A A A A A AWS, I probably want them to direct Bill. Interesting, because Randy told me the o or James told me the opposite, boot do everything in the marketplace. This is a new angle on it. He doesn't know the reason why is because I think you'll be able to teach him something. I think we can learn from each other. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that um'cause I so I chatted with Brent and Jonathan about it and we were both we were all like, you know what, at least for a trial period, let's just do that. Like uh text messaging service we go direct through carriers. They have like a you can start paying per token um for extra or
