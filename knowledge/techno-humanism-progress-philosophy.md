*Source: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TDmkDKzD5zdZruua7/announcing-the-techno-humanist-manifesto-a-new-philosophy-of - Added: 2026-01-18*

Jason Crawford (Roots of Progress Institute) is serializing a book laying out his "techno-humanist" philosophy.

### Core Definition

**Techno-humanism**: The view that science, technology, and industry are good—not in themselves, but because they ultimately promote human well-being and flourishing. Material progress leads to human progress.

This is explicitly **humanist and instrumental**: technology valued for human benefit, not as an end in itself.

### The Book's Purpose

1. Present a moral defense of material progress
2. Provide a framework for the progress movement to understand what they're doing and why
3. Offer a bold vision of a future worth building
4. Acknowledge and embrace the problems of progress while pointing toward solutions
5. Show how progress can become a moral ideal—goal to strive for, heroic archetype to emulate, responsibility to live up to

### Target Audience

- Scientists, engineers, founders who create material progress and seek moral meaning in their work
- Intellectuals, storytellers, policy makers
- Anyone curious about the "progress movement"

### Planned Structure

**Part 1: The Value of Progress**
- Fish in Water (gratitude for industrial civilization)
- The Surrender of the Gods
- The Glory of Man
- The Life Well-Lived
- Solutionism

**Part 2: The Future of Progress**
- The Flywheel (acceleration patterns in human development)
- The Problem-Solving Animal
- The Unlimited Horizon

**Part 3: A Culture of Progress**
- What We Lost (decline in optimism)
- The New Ideal
- What to Do

### Key Quote on Purpose

> "Movements begin with practice, but as they evolve, they need theory in order to maintain the coherence needed to change the world. Providing this is the role of what Joel Mokyr calls the 'cultural entrepreneur,' whose function is 'formulating a coherent doctrine that the followers can all accept as the consensus central message.'"

### Relationship to Other Tech Philosophies

**Contrast with Accelerationism/NRx** (see [[accelerationism-nrx-tech-politics.md]]):
- Techno-humanism is explicitly humanist; NRx is explicitly anti-humanist/Nietzschean
- Progress movement embraces democratic institutions; NRx sees democracy as obstacle
- Crawford frames technology as serving human flourishing; accelerationists frame AI/capitalism as self-directing forces
- Progress movement is reformist; accelerationism seeks regime change

**Contrast with Andreessen's "Techno-Optimist Manifesto":**
- Crawford's framing is more measured, acknowledges "problems of progress"
- Less combative, more focused on moral framework than culture war
- Explicitly non-original—pulling together existing ideas vs. declaring war on "enemies"

**Overlap with Dynamism:**
- Both embrace change, innovation, exploration
- Both see technological progress as fundamentally positive
- Progress movement provides moral/philosophical grounding for dynamist politics

### The Progress Movement

Crawford identifies an emerging "progress movement" that needs intellectual coherence. Key characteristics:
- Empirically grounded (history of technology, economic development)
- Morally optimistic about human agency
- Acknowledges trade-offs without rejecting progress
- Distinct from both techno-utopianism and techno-pessimism

## Why the Industrial Revolution Happened: Supply vs Demand Factors

*Source: https://rootsofprogress.org/robert-allen-british-industrial-revolution - Added: 2026-01-18*

Jason Crawford's review of Robert Allen's "The British Industrial Revolution in Global Perspective" (2009), examining economic vs cultural explanations for industrialization.

### Allen's Demand-Side Thesis

Innovation can be viewed like a product with supply (scientific knowledge, educated craftsmen) and demand (economic incentives). Allen argues demand factors have been underrated:

**Key demand factors for mechanization:**
- **High wages** - London/Amsterdam workers earned ~4x subsistence in 1700s; Vienna/Delhi/Beijing just above subsistence
- **Cheap energy** - Coal extraordinarily cheap in Newcastle near mines; England had world's best labor-to-energy cost ratio
- **Capital availability** - High wages relative to capital cost incentivized replacing labor with machines

**Case studies:**
- *Steam engines*: Newcomen engines only profitable where fuel nearly free (coal mines). Diffusion pattern followed coal fields, not superior culture
- *Textiles*: Spinning jenny had ~40% ROI in England, -9% in France due to wage differences. France adopted only after productivity improvements raised ROI
- *Iron smelting*: Coke smelting replaced charcoal in Britain because they ran out of wood first. French attempt at Le Creusot failed despite excellent technical support

### Crawford's Synthesis

Crawford accepts the weak version ("demand factors matter and were underrated") but rejects the strong version ("demand explains everything"). His critiques:

1. **Allen only explains mechanization/energy** - Can't explain concurrent developments in agriculture, navigation, chemistry, sanitation, democracy, abolition with factor prices. The Enlightenment can.

2. **Need to look earlier** - High wages and cheap energy came from prior growth (urbanization, trade, agricultural improvements). Where did THAT come from?

3. **Rate vs direction** - Demand factors may shape *direction* of progress but not *rate*. Rate driven by supply factors: scientific culture, literacy, bourgeois virtues.

### Key Takeaway

Industrialization was one phase of a broader story. Factor prices explain timing/location of specific technologies. Broader cultural/intellectual changes explain the longer arc of Western economic divergence.

Debates this contributes to:
- Joel Mokyr's "Industrial Enlightenment" thesis (supply-side)
- Nicholas Crafts: supply and demand views are complementary
- Great Divergence: why Europe pulled ahead of Asia

## American Acceleration vs Development: The Prioritization Debate

*Source: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QpEz8zuRYGbiivaWC/american-acceleration-vs-development (Maximum Progress blog) - Added: 2026-01-19*

Central tension in philanthropy and policy: Progress studies focuses on accelerating US growth, while effective altruism focuses on developing world interventions. Are these in conflict?

### The Case for American Acceleration

**Direct local benefits:**
- Deregulating housing = cheaper rent, higher wages for tens of millions
- But dollar-for-dollar less impactful than cash transfers to developing world

**Positive externalities (the stronger argument):**
1. **Investment flows** - US foreign direct investment grew ~30x from 1982-2022 ($207B → $6.5T). Investment to India grew 170x.
2. **Philanthropy** - Frontier growth funds Open Philanthropy, World Bank, IMF, UN. 1% growth increase → doubles philanthropic capacity in 20 years.
3. **Technology diffusion** - Internet, vaccines, automobiles, solar, fertilizer synthesis. Lion's share of developing world welfare gains came from rich-world innovations.

**Historical examples:**
- Smallpox eradication: American medical innovations + US funding (WHO, Rockefeller Foundation)
- Green Revolution: American agricultural innovations + philanthropic deployment
- Both required development workers too, but innovations/funding were the binding constraint

### Tractability Analysis

**Development interventions:**
- High tractability (cash transfers, malaria vaccines)
- Precisely measurable impact
- But improving developing world *growth rates* is much harder

**Progress studies/metascience:**
- Lower tractability for policy change
- BUT: "pulling the rope sideways" - not locked in left-right tug of war
- Small group of advocates, neglected space

**Why US is uniquely tractable:**
1. High state capacity/rule of law → reforms actually get implemented
2. Demand exists: H1-B cap increase → instant skilled worker inflow; housing deregulation → construction boom
3. Same reforms in Bulgaria or Botswana wouldn't have same effect due to lower demand to move/build there

### Counterarguments

**Reverse spillovers:**
- Developing countries can become innovation leaders (Japan)
- But: Japan relied on US power/investment/tech diffusion to develop
- Japan's patenting has declined for 30 years; many wealthy countries have low innovation

**Population dynamics:**
- Developed world is aging; population is key input to innovation
- India/Africa have most growth potential based on demographics
- Counter-counter: This argues for immigration to developed world, not just development aid

### Key Insight

The comparison isn't zero-sum. Progress studies and EA can both be underfunded. But on the margin:

> "A close focus on the institutions and culture of the US is justified even under a wide moral circle because the positive spillovers from increased frontier growth and innovation are so large and the potential for this growth resides primarily in America."

This is a utilitarian case for investing in rich-country innovation even when you care most about the global poor.

## The Threat of Technology: A Skeptic's Perspective

*Source: NeuroLogica Blog, Steven Novella - Added: 2026-01-19*

A science communicator's take on the dual-edged nature of technology - neither pure good nor existential evil, but a powerful tool requiring thoughtful regulation and collective responsibility.

### The Historical Context

Science and technology have been net positive for humanity:
- Freed us from "short, nasty, and brutish" existence
- Extended lives, improved health, controlled environment
- Enabled understanding of universe and microscopic world
- Will enable multi-world, multi-system species (if we survive)

**The romanticized past:** Period movies don't show reality - horrible dentition, ravaged by disease, living in drudgery, never seeing beyond small villages.

### The Dark Side Emerges

Same science and technology brings:
- Nuclear annihilation threat
- Global climate change
- Sixth mass extinction
- Engineered pandemic potential
- Destructive power in hands of individuals (terrorists, mentally unwell)

**Technology-specific risks:**
- Transportation: Mobility and cosmopolitanism vs. environmental poison and deaths
- Social media: Connection vs. psychopaths unleashed and social stress
- Computers: Productivity and information access vs. surveillance state
- AI: Research acceleration and efficiency vs. privacy/liberty elimination
- Genetic engineering: Challenges notions of being human
- Manufacturing: Greater individual power, but also greater destructive capacity

### Two Categories of Response

**1. Thoughtful Regulation**

As technologies emerge, we must:
- Explore potential uses and abuses
- Develop safety, responsibility, and transparency mechanisms
- Create debatable standards
- Seek international recognition

**Examples of existing regulation:**
- Gain-of-function research limits for infectious organisms
- Restrictions on human germ-line genetic modifications
- Fissile material controls

**The regulation problem:** Regulations are also double-edged - can have overreach, be based in fear/ignorance rather than responsible risk management. But this isn't reason for futility.

**2. Get Our Collective Shit Together (More Important)**

The greatest fear: What authoritarian governments will do with technology.

**Key questions:**
- Are we handing tyrants tools for total and permanent control?
- Will technology act as ratchet - locking in authoritarian governments once they get foothold as democracies vacillate?
- Can we make democracies more stable and functional?
- Can we enforce international human rights standards?

**Corporate tyranny risk:**
- Increasingly wealthy/powerful transnational corporations may have more influence than governments
- Examples: Tech giants, tobacco industry's health impact, fossil fuel industry's environmental impact
- Need balance: freedom to innovate vs. reigning in greed and exploitation

### The Critical Sciences for Survival

The most important sciences today may be:
- Political science
- Social science
- Social psychology
- Combined with: history, philosophy, ethics

**Without these disciplines advancing alongside technological sciences:** Dystopian future looks increasingly likely.

### The Central Challenge

> "Forging a stable global civilization in the face of rapidly progressing and destabilizing technology."

This is perhaps the greatest challenge humanity collectively faces.

**What's needed:** A system with checks and balances, and dynamic homeostatic stability. Not one solution, but an ecosystem of approaches.

### Comparison to Other Tech Philosophy

**Contrast with accelerationism** (see earlier section):
- Novella acknowledges regulation's downsides but sees it as necessary
- Accelerationists see most regulation as obstacles to progress
- Novella centers human dignity and democracy; accelerationists see democracy as incompatible with optimal progress

**Contrast with techno-humanism** (Crawford):
- Overlaps: both see technology as instrumental to human flourishing
- Novella more explicit about dystopian risks
- Crawford focuses on "problems of progress," Novella on governance/collective challenges

**Overlap with AI safety discourse:**
- Shares concerns about authoritarian use of technology
- Echoes Vatican's emphasis on human dignity
- Aligns with calls for thoughtful regulation over acceleration

### Key Insight

Technology is neither inherently good nor evil - it's a tool. The question isn't whether to develop new technologies, but:
1. How to regulate them thoughtfully
2. Whether our social/political institutions can mature fast enough to handle them

The most dangerous scenario: Advanced technology in hands of immature or malicious civilizations (whether authoritarian governments or extractive corporations).

## Why A Larger Population Benefits Everyone

*Source: https://rootsofprogress.org/why-a-larger-population (Jason Crawford) - Added: 2026-01-19*

Crawford argues against the "sustainable population" view (Ehrlich's 2 billion, Goodall's 500 million) with positive reasons to want population growth—not from utilitarian "sum of happiness" calculus, but from selfish individual benefits.

### Core Arguments

**More geniuses:**
- Genius defined as one-in-a-million intelligence
- Each billion people = 1,000 more geniuses working on humanity's problems
- Benefits all of humanity, not just the geniuses themselves

**More progress:**
- Larger population → faster scientific, technical, economic advancement
- Exponentially growing R&D investment (financial + human capital) required to maintain constant growth rate
- "Burden of knowledge" grows as frontier advances—each researcher must study more to reach the edge
- Newton could contribute to gravity AND optics; today's researchers devote careers to sub-sub-disciplines like nuclear astrophysics
- In some growth models, long-run per-capita GDP growth is directly proportional to population growth rate

**More variety and choices:**
- More careers, industries, communities to join
- More books, music, art, sports
- Easier to find soulmate/best friend/collaborator
- More niche markets served

### Deeper Patterns

1. **Division of labor**: Larger populations support more specialization, raising productivity for everyone
2. **Economies of scale**: Fixed costs (infrastructure, R&D) spread over more people → lower per-capita costs
3. **Agglomeration effects**: Bigger societies are better for everyone (network effects, knowledge spillovers)

### The Dynamic World Vision

A large and growing population creates a dynamic world that sustains progress—more discoveries, inventions, creative genius, disease cures, choices, and potential soulmates.

Contrast with the stagnant, impoverished vision of much-smaller-population advocates.

### Connection to Progress Philosophy

This extends the techno-humanist framework from "technology is good because it helps humans" to "more humans are good because they generate more technology and variety that helps all humans."

It's a selfish argument for population growth: even if you don't care about the sum total of human happiness, YOU benefit from living in a world with more people.
