## The A-Z Reference

| Principle | Description | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Anchor Effect** | First information heavily influences decisions | Set initial price/feature expectations strategically |
| **Bizarreness Effect** | Unusual information is remembered more easily | Make key features memorable through distinctiveness |
| **Confirmation Bias** | People prefer information that confirms their beliefs | Frame features in terms of users' existing worldview |
| **Decoy Effect** | A third option influences preference between two choices | Add a less attractive option to make target option shine |
| **Endowment Effect** | People overvalue things once possessed | Offer free trials—users value features more after trying them |
| **FOMO** | People fear missing out on experiences | Show social proof, activity feeds, limited availability |
| **Gamification** | Game elements drive engagement and motivation | Points, badges, progress bars, achievements |
| **Hyperbolic Discounting** | People prefer immediate, smaller rewards | Offer instant gratification over delayed benefits |
| **Illusory Superiority** | People overestimate their abilities | Let users feel skilled; don't make them feel incompetent |
| **Jamming Effect** | Excessive choices overwhelm and reduce satisfaction | Limit options, use smart defaults, progressive disclosure |
| **Kano Model** | User satisfaction varies with feature perception | Distinguish must-haves, satisfiers, and delighters |
| **Labor Illusion** | People value things more if they see underlying work | Show processing indicators, "working on it" animations |
| **Mere Exposure Effect** | People develop preferences for repeatedly exposed things | Consistent branding, familiar patterns build trust |
| **Nudge** | Subtle hints can influence users' decisions | Default selections, visual hierarchy, microcopy |
| **Occam's Razor** | Users tend to favor simpler explanations and solutions | Simplify interfaces—though some users want flexibility |
| **Peak-End Rule** | People judge experiences by peak and end moments | Ensure memorable positive endings to user flows |
| **Questionnaire Effect** | Asking about preferences influences future behavior | Onboarding surveys can shape user commitment |
| **Reciprocity** | People feel obligated to reciprocate | Give value first (free content, tools) before asking |
| **Scarcity** | Limited availability increases demand | Time-limited offers, limited seats, exclusive access |
| **Tiny Habits** | Goals achieved more easily in smaller steps | Break onboarding into small, achievable milestones |
| **Unit Bias** | People view one unit as the optimal amount | Package features/content in natural "units" |
| **Variable Reward** | Unexpected rewards increase enjoyment | Random bonuses, surprise delights, varied feedback |
| **Weber's Law** | Users adjust more easily to gradual changes | Introduce changes incrementally, not all at once |
| **Xenophily** | People are attracted to foreign, novel features | Novelty can differentiate—but balance with familiarity |
| **Yes-Set Principle** | Sequential 'yes' questions boost agreement | Start with easy asks before big commitments |
| **Zeigarnik Effect** | People recall uncompleted tasks more than completed ones | Progress indicators, incomplete profiles drive return visits |
