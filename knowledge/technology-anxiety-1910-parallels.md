# Technology, Speed, and Anxiety: Lessons from 1910

Historical parallels between early 20th century technological disruption and today's AI/digital age.

## The Historical Context

The 30-40 year span from 1875-1910 saw comparable technological disruption to our era:
- 1875 NYC: No electric lighting, Coca-Cola, basketball, aspirin, cars, or sneakers
- By 1910: Automobiles in France grew from 3,000 (1900) to 100,000 (1914); Ford produced 300,000 Model Ts in 1914

## The "Speed" Panic

### Physical Speed as Vice

Transportation technology (bicycle, automobile, airplane) triggered moral panic:
- "Diseases of the wheel" warned against
- Women cyclists accused of moral/sexual deviancy
- Speed itself was seen as unnatural

> "Automobilism is an illness, a mental illness. This illness has a pretty name: speed..."
> — Octave Mirbeau, French novelist, 1910

### The "Giants" Calculation

A 1905 article calculated human height needed to naturally walk at machine speeds:
- Bicycle pace: 40+ feet tall
- Fast train: 167 feet tall
- Racing car: approaching Notre Dame Cathedral height

## "American Nervousness" / Neurasthenia

### The Diagnosis

George Miller Beard diagnosed "neurasthenia" (nervous exhaustion) - Europe called it "American Nervousness." Symptoms mapped to what we'd now call burnout and anxiety.

### Who Was Affected

Disproportionately white-collar workers at "frontiers of technology":
- Telephone operators
- Typesetters on new machines
- Railway workers
- Engineers

An 1893 hospital survey: 200 businessmen, 130 civil servants, 68 teachers, 56 students, 11 farmers... and zero manual workers.

### Scale of Crisis

Germany mental hospital patients:
- 1870: 40,375
- 1900: 115,882
- 1910: 220,881

Plus countless more at private sanatoriums and spas (cf. Thomas Mann's *The Magic Mountain*).

## Artistic Response: Modernism as Reaction to Modernity

### The Paradox

What we call "Modernism" was largely a **reaction against** modernity - an excavation of something ancient in an age obsessed with novelty.

### Key Figures

**Igor Stravinsky** - *The Rite of Spring* (1913)
- Inspired by ancient Russian dance rituals
- Blended folk music with arresting dissonance
- First performance triggered violent audience response (fistfights, duels challenged)
- Now considered "the most famous composition of the early 20th century"

**Vassily Kandinsky** - Abstract painting
- Drew inspiration from Ural Mountain shamans
- Kodak camera (1888) devalued realistic representation
- Turned sound into image - synesthesia no camera could match
- Critics called it "the poison breath of the darkest places of vice"

**Pablo Picasso** - Primitivism
- Drew on African masks and West African carvings
- Aimed to represent "unchanging structure of the human condition"
- *Les Demoiselles d'Avignon* (1907) - "brutal and disturbing bluntness"

### The Pattern

Each artist "reacted to the alienation of the human mind from its own emotions" by pulling pre-modern styles into their work.

## Weber vs. Freud: The Ongoing Debate

### Max Weber's View

*The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*: Protestant traditions (especially Calvinist) cultivated habits aligned with capitalism:
- Disciplined work
- Savings and investment
- Worldly success as possible sign of divine favor

Implication: Capitalism evolved *from* religious doctrines that *fit our nature*.

### Sigmund Freud's View

Human nature at risk of being "dissolved by capitalism":
- **Id**: Animal urges
- **Superego**: Internalized social rules
- **Ego**: Stuck negotiating authentic identity amid mass inauthenticity

Key concept: **Sublimation** - redirecting unacceptable urges toward productive work.

Modern capitalism as sublimation of self-interest/greed. But: "the suppression of natural urges... will eventually exact its revenge on the individual."

### The Unresolved Question

> Are our most impressive inventions the ultimate expression of our humanity, or are they the ultimate threat to it?

Both Weber and Freud offer partial truths. The answer may be: both.

## Rhymes with Today

### Technology Panic Parallels
- Speed fears (bicycles → smartphones/AI)
- "Unnatural" technology arguments
- Concerns about women's use of technology
- Moral framing of tech adoption

### Mental Health Parallels
- White-collar workers most affected
- "Overwork" as common cause
- Sanatoriums → mental health apps
- "Burnout" as modern neurasthenia

### Artistic Response Parallels
- Reaching for authenticity in age of novelty
- Technology enabling new art forms while threatening old ones
- Critics dismissing new forms as pathology

### Capitalism/Human Nature Debate
- Same Weber/Freud tension in AI discussions
- "AI will liberate human potential" vs. "AI will destroy human meaning"
- Sublimation still operating

## Key Insight

> "Great history books remind us that while history never repeats itself, its themes never stop rhyming."

The disorientation we feel about AI, smartphones, and constant connectivity isn't unique to our era. The early 1900s faced comparable disruption and developed comparable anxieties.

What worked then:
- Artists channeled anxiety into groundbreaking work
- Society eventually adapted (though not without cost)
- Neither utopian nor dystopian predictions proved correct

## Book Recommendation

**"The Vertigo Years: Europe 1900-1914"** by Philipp Blom - Thompson calls it "the most underrated history book ever written."
