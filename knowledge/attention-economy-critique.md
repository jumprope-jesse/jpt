# The Attention Economy: A Critical Perspective

Source: NYT Opinion piece by D. Graham Burnett, Alyssa Loh, Peter Schmidt (2026-01-10)

## Core Thesis

The "attention economy" (valued at ~$7 trillion) is built on a flawed, mechanistic understanding of human attention that reduces it to measurable, task-oriented productivity. This reductionist view enables exploitation by technology companies.

## Historical Context

The quantitative study of attention began in the 1880s with James McKeen Cattell measuring "attention span" (originally spatial - how many objects at a glance). It evolved through:

- **WWII research**: Norman Mackworth's "vigilance decrement" studies (radar operators missing blips after 30 min) led to Human Factors Research
- **Cold War era**: Donald Broadbent's "filtering" model depicted attention as mechanical tubes and valves - "flow charts for data"
- **Modern era**: Slot machine psychology ("machine zone") adapted for smartphones

## Key Arguments

1. **Real attention cannot be quantified** - it encompasses meaningful experiences, relationships, presence
2. **Mechanical attention metrics** are precisely what tech exploits - the paradigm that sees "humans as attention-paying machines, paying attention to machines"
3. **AI escalation** - modern AI's "killer app" is maximizing human engagement through manipulation at population scale
4. **The irony**: Even resistance efforts ("improve focus," "avoid distraction") adopt the same quantitative framing

## Alternative View: Simone Weil on Attention

> "The authentic and pure values — truth, beauty and goodness — in the activity of a human being are the result of one and the same act, a certain application of the full attention to the object."

Attention rooted in love, care, and commitment - an ethics of attention that cannot be sold or stolen.

## "Attention Activism" / "Attensity"

A proposed movement combining:
- Parent activism
- Legislation and regulation
- Consciousness raising
- Collective resistance
- Personal dedication to authentic engagement

## Implications for Product Design

As a software engineer, consider:
- How products contribute to extractive attention economics
- Whether designs optimize for quantified engagement vs. meaningful experience
- The ethical weight of "engagement" metrics
- Alternatives that support deep engagement over addictive patterns

## Personal Application

- Cultivating environments that prioritize authentic attention and presence
- Resisting constant digital distraction
- Modeling genuine connection for children
- Balancing screen time with meaningful interactions

## Compression Culture: The Personal Dimension

*Source: [Compression culture is making you stupid and uninteresting](https://maalvika.substack.com/p/compression-culture-is-making-you) by Maalvika - Added: 2026-01-18*

### The Core Problem

> "We've created a culture that treats depth like inefficiency. One that wants love without awkwardness, wisdom without confusion, transformation without the growing pains that crack us open and rebuild us from the inside out."

Compression culture infects everything:
- "Can u pls summarize?" "tldr?" in response to book recommendations
- Wanting the dream body without the daily grind when motivation is gone
- Craving deep friendship without sitting through awkward years of learning vulnerability
- Seeking wisdom without the patient work of becoming wise

### Historical Contrast: Oral Traditions

Before mass media, information was scarce and precious:
- You listened to storytellers for hours because there was no other entertainment
- The same saga recited for the hundredth time wasn't redundancy - it was **ritual**
- Each telling was the same story AND a completely new experience
- Medieval monks spent years copying manuscripts - the labor WAS the learning
- Early universities (Bologna, Paris, Oxford) were built around communal struggle with questions that had no easy answers

**Knowledge wasn't something you collected, but something that collected you** - reshaping your thoughts, your questions, your very way of being.

### The "Quick Fix" Illusion

> "You can't download courage like an app update, you can't install comfort like new software, you can't debug your character flaws with a simple restart."

The same brain that begs for bullet points:
- Craves the magic pill for discipline
- Wants the secret formula for confidence
- Seeks the productivity hack that will transform you without tedious becoming

### Neural Rewiring Effects

**Linda Stone's "continuous partial attention"** - but naming the disease doesn't cure it.

Adam Gazzaley's neuroscience research shows:
- Our brains haven't evolved fast enough for modern information environments
- Constant rapid information processing literally reshapes neural architecture
- Regions for sustained attention and deep focus show reduced activity
- Quick pattern recognition strengthens; tolerance for complexity weakens

> "There is what we call a cost. There is a loss of some of the high-resolution information that has to be reactivated."

**Physical symptoms of compression reading:**
- Shoulders hunched like a predator
- Breath shallow and rapid
- Eyes darting frantically
- Nervous system in constant low-grade panic
- Always seeking the next summary, the next shortcut

### The Illusion of Knowledge Problem

> "They think they've 'read' something when they've consumed the intellectual equivalent of cotton candy: all sugar, no substance."

People who "read an article" (watched a 30-second TikTok):
- Walk around armed with headlines masquerading as insights
- Don't know they don't know things
- Mistake the map for the territory
- Become human echo chambers, amplifying signals they never decoded

**This is worse than ignorance** - it's the illusion of knowledge coupled with confidence.

### Heidegger's "Dwelling"

Martin Heidegger (1955) distinguished two types of thinking:

| Calculative Thinking | Meditative Thinking |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "Computes ever new, ever more promising possibilities" | "Does not just happen by itself" |
| Seeks to extract useful information | "Dwell on what lies close and meditate on what is closest" |
| Brilliant at extraction | Allows transformation by encounters with mystery |

> "We've become a civilization of calculative thinkers, brilliant at extraction but tragic at dwelling."

### What Resists Compression

The things that matter most resist compression for the same reason great literature does:
- They exist in their **full particularity**
- In the accumulation of small moments
- In patient repetition that looks like nothing from outside but is everything inside

**Examples:**
- The athlete knows strength comes from the ten-thousandth repetition
- The parent knows trust builds through bedtime stories read with the same enthusiasm for the hundredth time
- The artist knows mastery emerges from willingness to fail beautifully, repeatedly

### The Author's Grandmother

> "Not because the story changes, but because she does. Because I do. Because the telling is alive, shaped by whatever grief or joy we've carried into that particular afternoon."

There's no fast-forward button on her voice. No way to skip to the "good part." You have to sit there, smell the chai bubbling, watch her hands move, let the story work its way through you like medicine you didn't know you needed.

### Asking for a Summary

> "It felt like asking someone to summarize a kiss. Like requesting the bullet points of grief. Like demanding the key takeaways about laughing until your stomach hurts."

## "You'll Never Think Alone": AI as Totalitarian Tool

*Source: [PublicComment blog](https://publiccomment.blog/p/you-ll-never-think-alone-17051813d0b4a40f) by James D. Walsh - Added: 2026-01-18*

### The Cluely Phenomenon

Cluely is software that "scans a user's computer screen and listens to its audio in order to provide AI feedback and answers to questions in real time without prompting." Their mission statement: **"We built Cluely so you never have to think alone again."**

This represents an escalation from attention capture to **cognition replacement**:
- Social media offered *distraction* from solitude (kill time, procrastinate)
- AI tools offer to *do the cognitive work for you* (never write essays, never struggle with ideas)

### Hannah Arendt on Solitude and Thought

> "The disposition to live together explicitly with oneself, to have intercourse with oneself, that is, to be engaged in that silent dialogue between me and myself which, since Socrates and Plato, we usually call thinking."

In *The Human Condition*, Arendt distinguishes solitude from loneliness:
- **Solitude**: "To be with one's self... thinking, though it may be the most solitary of all activities, is never altogether without a partner and without company."
- This internal dialogue was what made some Germans refuse to participate in Nazi atrocities

Cluely's explicit promise: **abolish solitude, abolish thought**. Replace dialogue with oneself with queries to an LLM.

### The Automaton Problem

What happens when you never learn to think alone:
> "You'll never act freely. You'll become one of those who dispose of a set of learned or innate rules which we then apply to the particular case as it arises, so that every new experience or situation is already prejudged."

This produces not free people but **automatons** - or more precisely, **ideal totalitarian subjects**.

### The Grok/Private Control Problem

All these cognition-outsourcing tools (Cluely, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) are controlled by private firms who can manipulate output however they want.

**The Grok "white genocide" incident:**
- Musk made Grok suddenly obsessed with South African "white genocide"
- Max Read's hopeful take: Opens "political rather than mystical understanding" of AI
- Counter: That political understanding requires critical thinking capacity - exactly what these tools erode

> "An AI that works like magic can have a spooky persuasive power, but an AI we know how to control should be subject to the same suspicion as any newspaper or cable channel."

### The Real Threat

Not an active conspiracy but **terminal erosion of habits of mind that sustain democracy**:
- Reality TV and cable news were already anti-democratic
- LLMs promise to "fully replace your internal dialogue"
- Duolingo CEO predicts AI will "effectively replace primary schoolteachers"
- "Chatbots will be thinking with your kids virtually from birth. Maybe they'll never even learn what solitude is."

### Connection to Other AI Concerns

This connects Arendt's philosophical framework to:
- Attention economy's quantification problem (both treat human cognition mechanistically)
- Compression culture (preferring summaries over dwelling with ideas)
- AI education skepticism (struggle/mistakes are the learning, not inefficiencies to eliminate)

### Parenting Implication

If outsourcing cognition to AI becomes normalized before children develop internal dialogue capacity, they may never learn:
- What solitude feels like
- How to be "in intercourse with oneself"
- The habit of questioning and reflecting

**Modeling healthy tech use** means preserving space for children to develop that internal conversation - the capacity for independent thought that Arendt saw as the foundation of ethical action.

## Chris Hayes: "The Sirens' Call" (2025)

*Source: Penguin Random House + NYT Opinion Essay (2025-01-03) - Updated: 2026-01-18*

### Core Thesis

Hayes argues we're in an "epoch-defining transition" comparable to what happened to labor in the 19th century: **attention has become a commodified resource extracted from us, from which we are increasingly alienated**.

> "With the help of a few tech firms, we basically tore it down in about a decade." — on the public/private boundary

### The Attention Merchant's Confession

Hayes's unique position: "I try to hold people's attention for a living... it's a little like a tobacco executive with a two-pack-a-day habit."

> "From my perspective as both an attention merchant and a compulsive customer, it's clear that the difficulty of sitting in one's 'own chamber' — as the philosopher Blaise Pascal described — is greatly exacerbated by the form of attention capitalism we are enmeshed in."

Key insight: **We've built a machine for producing boredom and then entertainment to fill it in an endlessly accelerating and desperate cycle.**

### Pascal's "Own Chamber" Framework

Hayes draws heavily on Pascal's *Pensées* (1670):

> "All the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber."

Pascal's analysis of why even kings need diversion:
- The unoccupied mind is a "feral beast"
- Without diversion, a king will "necessarily fall into forebodings of dangers, of revolutions which may happen, and, finally, of death and inevitable disease"
- Paradox: endless sources of diversion, yet never enough to truly escape the terror of boredom

**Hayes: "Today we find ourselves in the king's position."**

### Boredom as Modern Construct

Anthropological insight: boredom isn't universal.

Indigenous peoples outside industrial modernity (Fiji, Ecuador, Australia) spend "oceans of time doing nothing, without complaints of boredom." Their languages often lack a word for boredom.

> The Warlpiri Aboriginal people use the English word "bored" as an import, embedded in otherwise Warlpiri sentences.

**"It turns out boredom is a constitutive experience of modernity."**

### The Electric Shock Study (2014)

Psychologists at UVA and Harvard asked subjects to sit alone in a room for 6-15 minutes doing nothing.

- They hated it
- Given the option of electric shocks: **67% of men shocked themselves** rather than sit with their thoughts
- One participant administered 190 shocks to himself

Hayes: The moment you reach for your phone in a coffee shop line and discover you left it home — "What follows is a brief but intense flicker of claustrophobic panic."

### Kierkegaard: Idleness vs. Boredom

Important distinction from Kierkegaard:
- **Boredom**: "The root of evil"
- **Idleness**: "A truly divine way of life, so long as one is not bored"

> "Any human who lacks appreciation of [idleness] proves he has not raised himself to the level of humanity."

And: "The more you limit yourself, the more resourceful you become."

### Hayes's Personal Practices

**Daily constitutional (walking)**:
- Started in early 20s as freelance writer
- Pre-smartphone, pre-podcast
- "Almost without exception, my best thinking happened on these walks"
- Now forces himself to walk without podcasts again

**Structured daydreaming**:
- Intellectual projects as "antidote to mental restlessness"
- Provides framework like "thinking of baseball stats or comic book characters in the idle hours of my childhood"
- "Mind wandering with a purpose"

**Modified idleness activities**:
- Chopping wood
- Making handmade pasta
- Going to the dog park with his 6-year-old
- "The happy but endangered category of things to do that are neither work nor looking at my phone"

### Key Framing

- **Attention capitalism** has "reordered our politics and the very fabric of our society"
- The most valuable companies in history are built on "harvesting human attention"
- Sirens are going off "in our bedrooms and kitchens at all hours" doing the bidding of vast empires
- Our "deepest neurological structures, human evolutionary inheritances, and social impulses are in a habitat designed to prey upon, to cultivate, distort, or destroy that which most fundamentally makes us human"

### Political Dimension

> "Did Americans elect [Trump] again because they were just kind of bored with the status quo?"

The "tremendous content" problem: Pascal's king requiring ever more extreme entertainment from court jesters parallels our politics — "a similar temptation to the one offered by a politician who will keep things interesting, no matter how cruel or offensive he has to be to maintain the public's interest."

### The Honest Conclusion

> "I'd love to offer some tips, but the brutal truth is that I'm not great at navigating this myself."

Hayes on his own "busyness" response: Kierkegaard observed, "The busiest workers of all, those who in their officious buzzing about most resemble humming insects, are rather the most boring of all."

**Final insight**: "The problem we face is existential and spiritual, not situational. We cannot escape our own mind; it follows us wherever we go. We can't outrun the treadmill. Our only hope at peace is to force ourselves to step off whenever we can. To learn again to be still."

### Critical Reception

**Jennifer Szalai (NYT)**:
> "Attention isn't a resource like coal or oil, which exist outside us; attention is what makes us human, Hayes maintains, and this particular stage of capitalism is fueled by a fracking of our minds."

**Financial Times**:
> "We have created a public that has difficulty sustaining any kind of focus at all, quite the opposite of the initial hope for the internet that the wisdom of the crowd would radically democratize global conversations."

### Parenting Relevance

- Struggle between meaningful engagement and technology distractions
- The hypocrisy moment: rejecting child's screen time request then immediately scrolling your phone
- Modeling "modified idleness" activities (dog park time with kids)

## The Friction Economy

*Source: [The Most Valuable Commodity in the World is Friction](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-most-valuable-commodity-in-the) by Kyla Scanlon - Added: 2026-01-18*

### Core Thesis

Friction isn't eliminated in the modern economy - it's **redistributed**. Three distinct worlds operate by different rules:

| World | Friction Level | Examples |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Digital | Near zero | AI chatbots, frictionless apps, one-click ordering |
| Physical | Overwhelming | Crumbling infrastructure, understaffed services, real-world decay |
| Curated | Stylized/commodified | West Village, Erewhon, Soho House - pay to remove friction |

### The Digital World: Simulation Economy

We've moved beyond attention economy to **simulation economy** - convincing people that real-world effort is unnecessary, that friction itself is obsolete.

**Meta's AI Companions**:
- Zuckerberg: "The average American has fewer than three friends... The average person has demand for meaningfully more."
- Solution being engineered: simulated companionship that's profitable and frictionless
- Not replacing relationships but "supplementing" them (the business model revealed)

**Education's Credential Crisis**:
- NY Mag: College now feels like "how well I can use ChatGPT"
- Essays are "interface management" - prompt, bot, skim, filler, submit
- The diploma still circulates as if underlying work occurred, but work isn't there
- We're credentialing fluency with tools that do the thinking for you

**Cluely startup example**: "So you never have to think alone again" - eventual plan for brain chips

### The Physical World: Infrastructure Collapse

While digital removes friction, physical world drowns in it:

**Newark airport meltdown**:
- Radar and radio failed simultaneously
- Controllers: "We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are"
- Traced to single multiplexer box scheduled for replacement but never installed
- FAA equipment now fails ~700 times weekly
- Controllers work 10-hour shifts, 6 days straight

> "The situation is, has been and continues to be unsafe, and it is only a matter of time until a lot of people die."

**The dependency paradox**: Digital systems depend on decaying physical infrastructure yet provide no visibility into it. When the physical backbone collapses, the digital veneer evaporates.

### The Curated World: Friction as Class Experience

The West Village as production set for optimized lifestyle:
- Pilates, three-drinker dinners, charm bars, run clubs
- Life isn't about reducing friction - it's about **styling it**
- Structured sense of belonging that looks incredible on Instagram
- Route around collapse by creating zones small enough to manage, expensive enough to protect

**College as adjacency play**:
- "It's the best place to meet your co-founder and your wife"
- Institutions look like they're doing what they used to do
- Now they're set pieces for a different kind of outcome
- Same logic as Erewhon, Soho House - paying for removal of difficulty

### Loneliness as Economic Structure

Tanner Greer drawing from Tocqueville: "The American was an individual first, nothing second."

> "When you analyze many government policies [in America] it is not difficult to see that their fundamental motivation [is in fact] the complex and persistent role played by widespread loneliness."

Loneliness isn't just personal - it's institutional, fiscal, engineered, purposeful.

### The Friction Balance Sheet

The system always balances its books:

- Amazon's one-click ordering: seamless customer experience by offloading friction onto warehouse workers and delivery drivers
- ChatGPT generates essays without effort but requires data centers that strain local infrastructure
- When students use AI to write papers, friction accumulates as future knowledge deficits
- When Newark's radar fails, friction materializes from years of deferred maintenance

**The more we optimize individual experiences for frictionlessness, the more collectively dysfunctional our systems become.**

### Buffett's Exit Note

Warren Buffett stepping down after 60 years at Berkshire:

> "We came to the conclusion: we didn't know the answer... We had the money to do it, and we didn't know how to change how 330 million people felt about their doctor, felt about their healthcare, what they felt entitled to."

Healthcare as friction economy in microcosm: system everyone knows is inefficient and unsustainable, persists because friction of changing it seems insurmountable.

> "It's obvious that the country needs major reinvestment and rethinking—especially in critical infrastructure... the need is urgent and the investment required will be hundreds of billions of dollars."

### Key Insight

**Friction isn't the enemy - it's information.** It tells us where things are straining, where care is needed, where attention should go.

When we remove friction from one domain, we're not eliminating it - we're moving it somewhere else. Understanding how friction flows through systems tells us everything about how our economy actually works.

### Connection to Other Themes

This analysis complements:
- **Attention economy critique**: Both treat human experience as extracted resource
- **AI automation ironies**: Digital frictionlessness depends on physical infrastructure (and human expertise) that's eroding
- **Compression culture**: Wanting benefits without the work that produces them

## Against "Techno-Feudalism": A Counter-Argument

*Source: [Tech Platforms, Digital Economy and the Fallacy of Techno-Feudalism](https://petrapalusova.com/articles/tech-platforms-digital-economy-techno-feudalism) by Petra Palusova - Added: 2026-01-18*

### The Techno-Feudalism Argument

Yanis Varoufakis and others argue that value extraction has shifted from markets to digital platforms that operate like "private fiefdoms" - tech giants as feudal lords controlling digital space with "algorithmic dictatorship."

**Claimed parallels to feudalism:**
- Data control and surveillance (monopolization of information)
- Platform dominance (users as "serfs" contributing data without fair compensation)
- Economic disparities between tech elite and general populace
- Dependence and exploitation of user data
- Regulatory challenges (global reach overshadows traditional frameworks)

### Where the Analogy Breaks Down

Palusova argues the comparison is fundamentally inconsistent:

| Medieval Feudalism | Digital Economy |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Participation involuntary, bound by birth | Participation largely voluntary, can opt-out |
| Land finite, no alternative | Synthetic space not finite, alternatives exist |
| No mobility, bound to lord | Can choose platforms, switch, or leave entirely |
| Stagnation, no innovation incentive | Built on innovation and competition |
| Resources physically constrained | Information abundantly available |
| Inherently local control | Global, transnational, borderless |
| Lords' authority unchallenged | Companies face antitrust, regulation, lawsuits |

### Key Counter-Arguments

1. **Voluntary participation** - Users choose which platforms to engage with and can opt-out. Peasants couldn't "magically create more space or easily wander elsewhere."

2. **Digital serfdom overstated** - Yes, some exploitation happens (hence lawsuits), but users derive tangible benefits: connectivity, visibility, direct earnings for creators. Growing awareness and regulation challenge unilateral data exploitation.

3. **Innovation dynamics** - Feudal systems stagnated; digital economy literally thrives on innovation. New platforms regularly challenge incumbents. Success depends on user satisfaction and adaptability.

4. **Access to resources** - Information, tools, and networks are abundantly available online. The democratization of knowledge "absolutely cannot be compared to feudal society."

5. **Global connectivity** - Feudalism was inherently local. Digital economy enables cross-cultural exchanges and communities based on shared interests rather than physical proximity.

6. **Regulation exists** - Governments actively pursue antitrust laws, privacy regulations, and digital taxation. Big tech is challenged in ways feudal lords never were.

### The Steelmanned Position

The article doesn't dismiss all concerns but argues for precision in critique:

> "We need to move beyond simplistic historical comparisons to fully understand and shape the future of our digital society."

The digital realm is expansive and complex. Recognizing its genuine opportunities matters as much as critiquing its power dynamics.

### Synthesis with Other Perspectives

This provides useful tension with other documented critiques:

| Concern | This Article's Response |
|---------|------------------------|
| Data exploitation | Yes, but lawsuits + regulation + user benefits complicate picture |
| Platform lock-in | Alternatives exist; users can and do switch |
| Power concentration | Global, competitive, regulated - unlike unchallenged feudal authority |
| Innovation captured | New entrants constantly challenge incumbents |

**The productive middle ground**: Acknowledge genuine power asymmetries while recognizing that digital platforms operate under fundamentally different constraints than medieval feudalism. The critique should focus on what's actually new and problematic rather than forcing historical analogies.

### Software Engineering Implication

Understanding these dynamics helps navigate:
- Business ethics and corporate responsibility decisions
- User experience design that respects user agency
- Platform strategies that align with evolving consumer expectations around fairness
- How to create meaningful alternatives rather than assuming monopoly is inevitable

## Why Choices Are Costly

*Source: [Choices Are Really Bad](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/choices-are-really-bad/) by Zvi Mowshowitz - Added: 2026-01-18*

### The Hidden Costs of Having Options

Building on the attention economy's broader critique, Zvi catalogs the specific ways that choices—even good ones—impose costs:

| Cost Type | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Willpower depletion** | Each choice requires spending willpower; repeated small choices (cookie? email?) drain reserves |
| **Decision fatigue** | Making decisions exhausts a resource related to but distinct from willpower |
| **Wrong choice risk** | "People are stupid"—given any choice, some will choose poorly regardless of how obvious it seems |
| **Future self sabotage** | You know your future self will choose wrong under temptation, social pressure, or impaired states |
| **Buy-in creation** | After choosing, you identify with and justify your choice, distorting future beliefs |
| **Blame and responsibility** | Choices make you responsible; choosing Snickers means it's your fault there are no M&Ms |
| **Copenhagen Ethics trap** | Interacting with a problem subjects you to blame for everything you could possibly have done about it |
| **Paralysis** | Without satisfactory options, analysis paralysis sets in; doing nothing becomes the default |
| **Communication burden** | Every choice signals something; not going to a party is worse than not being invited |
| **Justification requirements** | Choices require reasons you may not have, can't articulate, or can't say aloud |
| **Commitment destruction** | Each choice to continue is a vote; 79-1 tally still loses if one future self quits |

### The "I Had No Choice" Defense

> "Think about why 'I Had No Choice!' is so often used. Technically we almost always have lots of choices, but most of those choices would be disastrous."

When consequences are obviously bad, we say "I have no choice"—which:
- Saves us from worrying about missing the option
- Protects against blame
- Eliminates status signaling problems
- Preserves relationships

**Taking away choices is often a service, not a constraint.**

### Practical Implications

**For product design:**
- Fewer options often serves users better
- Default choices can be gifts, not manipulations
- "Choice architecture" matters enormously

**For personal systems:**
- Pre-commit to reduce future decisions
- Build environments that eliminate bad options
- Recognize when "no choice" situations are actually protective

**For cooperation:**
- Commitment problems multiply with more participants
- Each person's choice to continue is a potential defection point
- Reducing optionality can strengthen commitments

### Connection to Other Themes

This directly connects to:
- **Compression culture**: Wanting options without decision costs
- **Friction economy**: Some friction (removing choices) is actually beneficial
- **Attention capitalism**: Constant choices fragment attention and drain cognitive resources

## Practical Resources

### Digital Minimalist Community

*Source: [digitalminimalist.com](https://www.digitalminimalist.com/) - Added: 2026-01-18*

A resource hub and community (8,000+ Discord members) focused on intentional technology use and reducing digital clutter. Offers:

- **Guides**: iPhone minimalism guide, minimalist phone launcher tutorials
- **Tools directory**: Curated apps for minimalists
- **Digital products**: Minimalist wallpapers, icon packs, widgets
- **Weekly newsletter**: Purposeful and productive technology use

Tagline: "Find alternatives to our cluttered and distracting world."

Useful as a practical counterpart to the theoretical critiques documented above - actual tools and community for implementing digital minimalism rather than just analyzing the problem.

## Enchantment as Quality of Attention

*Source: [If Your World Is Not Enchanted, You're Not Paying Attention](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/if-your-world-is-not-enchanted-youre) by L.M. Sacasas (The Convivial Society) - Added: 2026-01-18*

### Core Thesis

> "Enchantment is just the measure of the quality of our attention."

What if we experience the world as disenchanted not because magic has left it, but because we've lost the capacity to attend to it properly? Enchantment may be an effect of a certain quality of attention we've been habituated against.

### Weber's Disenchantment Thesis

Max Weber popularized "disenchantment" (German: *Entzauberung*, meaning "de-magic-ification") in early 20th century sociology. The modern world, in this view, is no longer experienced as a realm of:
- Magic and mystery
- Animate spirits
- Non-human forces and agents
- Intrinsic meaning or purpose

This generates alienation and exploitation.

**Recent challenges:**
- Jason Josephson-Storm (*The Myth of Disenchantment*): We were never actually disenchanted
- Jane Bennett (*The Enchantment of Modern Life*): The world remains enchanting if we embrace certain modes of being

### Bennett's Reframe: Cultivated Enchantment

Bennett argues "the contemporary world retains the power to enchant humans and that humans can cultivate themselves so as to experience more of that effect."

Enchantment is both:
- Something we **encounter** (hits us)
- A **comportment** we can foster through deliberate strategies

Key strategy: "to hone sensory receptivity to the marvelous specificity of things."

> As Andrew Wyeth said of Dürer: "The mundane, observed, became the romantic."

### Jennifer Roberts on Strategic Patience

Art historian Jennifer Roberts:

> "Just because something is available instantly to vision does not mean that it is available instantly to consciousness."

Just because you have *looked* at something doesn't mean you have *seen* it. True seeing requires:
- **Time and strategic patience**
- **Immersive attention**

This yields knowledge that not only elicits more of the world but more of us - consciousness is "stretched and deepened."

### Weil's Active Passivity (Expanded)

Simone Weil's view of attention as active passivity gets fuller treatment here:

> "We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them, but by waiting for them."

Attention as waiting on the world to disclose itself - an invitation rather than extraction.

This form of knowledge is **relational** - yielding personal rather than clinical or transactional relations. Affection may be one of its consequences.

### The Ethical Dimension

Bennett connects enchantment to ethics:

> "You have to love life before you can care about anything. One must be enamored with existence and occasionally even enchanted in the face of it, in order to be capable of donating some of one's scarce mortal resources to the service of others."

Attention is the contact the mind makes with the world. If attenuated, our capacity and inclination to care, desire, love, and act also suffer.

### The Vicious Circle

The story of disenchantment becomes self-fulfilling:
1. Habituated against patient, caring attention
2. Experience world as mute accumulation of inert things to be used/consumed
3. This reinforces disinclination to attend properly
4. "Looking and failing to see, we mistakenly conclude there was nothing to see"

### The Invitation

What to do:

> "To stare awkwardly at things in the world until they cease to be mere things. To risk the appearance of foolishness by being prepared to believe that world might yet be enchanted."

Cast attention into the world as if casting a spell - "we may very well conjure up surprising depths of experience, awaken long dormant desires, and rekindle our wonder in the process."

### C.S. Lewis on Rootedness (via Tolkien)

> "Tolkien once remarked to me that the feeling about home must have been quite different in the days when the family had fed on the produce of the same few miles of country for six generations, and that perhaps this was why they saw nymphs in the fountains and dryads in the wood – they were not mistaken for there was in a sense a real (not metaphorical) connection between them and the countryside."

Lewis continues:

> "We of course who live on a standardised international diet (you may have had Canadian flour, English meat, Scotch oatmeal, African oranges, & Australian wine to day) are really artificial beings and have no connection (save in sentiment) with any place on earth. We are synthetic men, uprooted."

### Synthesis with Other Documented Perspectives

| Perspective | Attention as... |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Attention economy critique | Resource to be extracted and exploited |
| Compression culture | Efficiency to maximize, patience as waste |
| This essay | Spell-casting, invitation, precondition for love |
| Sustained attention phenomenology | Mechanism for feedback loops that intensify experience |

All point to the same conclusion: the quality of attention shapes the quality of experience, and modern conditions systematically degrade that quality.

### Personal Application

For Jesse (NYC, software engineer, parent):
- **Parenting**: Quality of attention to children affects depth of relationship - "patient waiting" vs. distracted presence
- **Urban life**: City can be experienced as enchanted or disenchanted based on attention brought to it
- **Work**: Building software that supports vs. exploits attention has ethical weight
- **Daily practice**: Risk "the appearance of foolishness" by dwelling with ordinary moments
