# The Attention Economy: A Critical Perspective

Source: NYT Opinion piece by D. Graham Burnett, Alyssa Loh, Peter Schmidt (2026-01-10)

## Core Thesis

The "attention economy" (valued at ~$7 trillion) is built on a flawed, mechanistic understanding of human attention that reduces it to measurable, task-oriented productivity. This reductionist view enables exploitation by technology companies.

## Historical Context

The quantitative study of attention began in the 1880s with James McKeen Cattell measuring "attention span" (originally spatial - how many objects at a glance). It evolved through:

- **WWII research**: Norman Mackworth's "vigilance decrement" studies (radar operators missing blips after 30 min) led to Human Factors Research
- **Cold War era**: Donald Broadbent's "filtering" model depicted attention as mechanical tubes and valves - "flow charts for data"
- **Modern era**: Slot machine psychology ("machine zone") adapted for smartphones

## Key Arguments

1. **Real attention cannot be quantified** - it encompasses meaningful experiences, relationships, presence
2. **Mechanical attention metrics** are precisely what tech exploits - the paradigm that sees "humans as attention-paying machines, paying attention to machines"
3. **AI escalation** - modern AI's "killer app" is maximizing human engagement through manipulation at population scale
4. **The irony**: Even resistance efforts ("improve focus," "avoid distraction") adopt the same quantitative framing

## Alternative View: Simone Weil on Attention

> "The authentic and pure values — truth, beauty and goodness — in the activity of a human being are the result of one and the same act, a certain application of the full attention to the object."

Attention rooted in love, care, and commitment - an ethics of attention that cannot be sold or stolen.

## "Attention Activism" / "Attensity"

A proposed movement combining:
- Parent activism
- Legislation and regulation
- Consciousness raising
- Collective resistance
- Personal dedication to authentic engagement

## Implications for Product Design

As a software engineer, consider:
- How products contribute to extractive attention economics
- Whether designs optimize for quantified engagement vs. meaningful experience
- The ethical weight of "engagement" metrics
- Alternatives that support deep engagement over addictive patterns

## Personal Application

- Cultivating environments that prioritize authentic attention and presence
- Resisting constant digital distraction
- Modeling genuine connection for children
- Balancing screen time with meaningful interactions
