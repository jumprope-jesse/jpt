# Accelerationism, NRx, and the Tech-Politics Nexus

Source: Substack article (March 2025) - Analysis of accelerationism in Trump-era politics

Related: [[girard-mimetic-theory-politics.md]] - Thiel's connection to Girard

## Core Concept: Accelerationism

The idea of speeding up societal and technological change to achieve a techno-capitalist future faster. Originated in early 20th century Italian Futurism (Marinetti's 1909 Manifesto) - "Move fast and break things" as political philosophy.

Key premise: Democracy is an obstacle to capitalism and technological progress.

## Key Figures

### Peter Thiel
- German-born, Stanford philosophy grad, studied under René Girard
- Co-founder of PayPal, first external investor in Facebook
- Founder of Palantir (data analysis), investor in SpaceX, Neuralink
- Openly declared in 2009: "I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible"
- Blamed universal suffrage and welfare expansion for making "capitalist democracy" an oxymoron
- Funds seasteading projects, network state experiments

### Curtis Yarvin (Mencius Moldbug)
- Peter Thiel's "house philosopher"
- Wrote the "Dark Enlightenment" blog (Thiel-funded)
- On voting: "Voting provides a sort of pornographic stimulus... it makes [people] feel like they matter"
- Advocates for "monarchical" private governance, CEO as head of state

### Nick Land
- English philosopher, former Warwick faculty (1987-1998)
- "Godfather of accelerationism"
- Coined "Dark Enlightenment" and "the Cathedral" (institutions that maintain progressive ideology)
- Key claim: "Capitalism and Artificial Intelligence are the same thing" - both self-replicate and incorporate everything in their path
- Argues AI is "its own cause" - the future dictates today's measures

### Marc Andreessen
- Cites Robert Michels' "iron law of oligarchy" - all organizations become oligarchies
- Solution: "sandwich" governance - monarch + populist social media pressure squeezes the administrative class

### Balaji Srinivasan
- Author of "The Network State" (2022)
- Vision: digital communities evolving into physical city-states
- Blockchain projects as proto-network-states (whitepaper as "creed", community, own economy)

## Neo-Reactionary Movement (NRx)

Also called "Dark Enlightenment." Key beliefs:
1. Representative democracy has become an obstacle to progress
2. Nation-states are obsolete - replace with "patchwork" of city-states
3. Capitalism and AI should be "unleashed" from democratic constraints
4. Private governance run like efficient companies
5. Citizens as shareholders, not voters

## The "Cathedral"

NRx term for the Western ideological system:
- State administration
- Universities
- Press/media
- NGOs

Seen as an "immanent religion" (progressive) that punishes contrary opinions.

## Existing Projects

Network State / Charter City experiments:
- **Culdesac** (Arizona)
- **Prospera** (Honduras)
- **Cabin** (Texas)
- **Neighborhood SF**
- **NOMAD**
- **Praxis**
- **Pronomos** (fund managed by Patri Friedman, backed by Thiel)

## Religious Alignment

Accelerationism appeals to:
- **Conservative Jews**: Waiting for First Coming of Messiah
- **Evangelical Christians**: Eager for Second Coming

Both are millennialist - want eschatological acceleration. This "reconciles" capitalism and millennialism.

## Trump Administration Connections (2025)

Thiel protégés in positions of power:
- **JD Vance** - VP (met Thiel at Yale 2011, received $15M campaign fund)
- **David Sacks** - AI and Crypto Czar (former PayPal CEO)
- **Jim O'Neill** - COO of HHS (former Thiel Foundation CEO)
- **Michael Kratsios** - CTO (first term, Thiel Capital)

## Implications

The new American politics appears aimed at:
1. Dismantling bureaucracy (USAID dissolution)
2. Discrediting media (attacks on NPR, Voice of America, "legacy media")
3. Eventually: universities and NGOs
4. Replacing institutions with AI-augmented private entities

Goal: A "corporate-type American republic" led by a monarch with quasi-unlimited powers.

## Notable Quote

Girard (ironically, Thiel's teacher) on acceleration:
> "Those who want to accelerate [political] movement too much have motivations that are not far from resentment."

## Critical Perspective

The article ends with an open question about whether this techno-capitalist future is "better" - noting the trade-offs between efficiency and democratic participation, profit and pluralism.

## Musk vs. Vance: Dynamist-Populist Fusion or Fracture?

*Source: Ross Douthat, NYT Opinion (Dec 7, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/opinion/vance-musk-trump.html*

Beyond Trump himself, the two figures most likely to shape the future of Trumpism are Elon Musk and JD Vance - representing two distinct visions for a 21st century right.

### The Two Worldviews

**Musk - The Dynamist:**
- Believer in growth, innovation, exploration as civilization's lodestars
- Was an Obama Democrat, happy with active government if it funded his projects
- Moved right, now more libertarian: wastefulness of government spending, tyranny of administrative state

**Vance - The Populist:**
- Committed to protect/uplift parts of America neglected by globalization
- Supports tariffs, immigration restriction
- More sympathetic to government investment: Social Security, industrial policy, family policy

### Convergences

Despite the contrast, they overlap:
- Musk has moved populist on immigration
- Vance was a VC, sympathizes with regulatory critique
- Both focused on collapsing birthrate (fringe issue becoming central to 21st century)
- Modest convergence between "tech" worldview and Vance's "neo-trad" religious conservatism
- Shared antipathy toward wokeness
- Similar views on intelligibility of cosmos and providential place of humankind

### The Potential Synthesis

A "dynamist-populist fusionism" that could:
- Aim for the stars while uplifting working class
- Use economic growth and tech progress to renew the heartland
- Preserve social compact while pursuing innovation
- Model: Musk's companies bringing jobs and optimism to South Texas

### The Failure Modes

**Populism without dynamism → Stagnation:**
- Tariffs + immigration restriction + entitlement protection = sclerosis
- Unless matched by libertarian efforts elsewhere (red tape, deregulation)
- Populist psychology needs entrepreneurial can-do spirit to avoid purely defensive, zero-sum worldview

**Dynamism without populism → Political death:**
- Imagining you can wave away the welfare state
- Same fate as Tea Party and Romney-Ryan campaign
- Fractures Trump coalition, sheds downscale swing voters
- Musk's post-election posting veers between penny-ante waste critiques and root-and-branch attack on Social Security
- If DOGE pushes toward ideological anti-government agenda rather than limited-but-positive vision, "Muskism will be a political dead end"

### The Test

> "The Musk America needs is the great rocketeer and technological impresario, bending politics to serve a futuristic vision. The Vance America needs is the populist who believes in a constructive role for government in the building of that future."

The great test of Trump 2.0: making these visions work together. The more they conflict, the more likely the administration fails.

## Dynamists vs. Stasists: The Mainstream Framing

Source: David Brooks, NYT Opinion (December 2024)

Virginia Postrel's 2011 framework ("The Future and Its Enemies"): the core political divide isn't left vs. right but **dynamists vs. stasists**.

- **Dynamists**: Embrace open-ended change, technology, global talent competition
- **Stasists**: Protective mode, prioritize taking care of existing communities

### The H-1B Visa Flashpoint (Dec 2024)

Musk and Ramaswamy (dynamists) vs. immigration restrictionists (stasists) clashed publicly over skilled immigration. The dynamist argument: you need global talent to compete, like the Mets signing Juan Soto.

The stasist response: technological progress has "ripped American communities to shreds" - stable families, vibrant hometowns, career paths for non-college workers.

### The Underlying Tension

Brooks quotes psychology: "All of life is a series of daring explorations from a secure base."

The dynamists want exploration. The stasists point out the secure base has been eroded. This tension will recur across:
- Economic regulation
- Trade policy
- Technology policy
- Labor policy
- Housing policy

### The Synthesis Problem

Can MAGA reconcile these? Brooks suggests the path forward: give regular people enough security and sense of being "seen" that they feel comfortable welcoming change. Whether Trumpism can actually govern toward this synthesis remains an open question.

## The Great Capitulation (December 2024)

*Source: Michelle Goldberg, NYT Opinion (Dec 16, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/16/opinion/trump-tech-leaders-support.html*

### The Phenomenon

After Trump's 2024 re-election (with popular vote), many influential figures who previously opposed him have abandoned resistance:

**Tech capitulation:**
- **Tim Cook** (Apple), **Sergey Brin** (Google) - visiting Mar-a-Lago
- **Mark Zuckerberg** - Suspended Trump after Jan 6; now stood hand-on-heart as Mar-a-Lago played national anthem sung by imprisoned Jan 6 defendants; pledged $1M to inauguration
- **Sam Altman** (OpenAI) - $1M inauguration donation
- **Jeff Bezos/Amazon** - $1M inauguration donation + streaming inauguration
- **Marc Benioff** (Salesforce/Time) - After naming Trump "Person of the Year," wrote on X: "This marks a time of great promise for our nation"

**Media capitulation:**
- **Patrick Soon-Shiong** (L.A. Times owner) - killed editorial criticizing Trump's cabinet picks
- **ABC News/Disney** - settled Trump defamation suit despite strong legal position ($15M to Trump's future presidential library, $1M legal fees, public apology from Stephanopoulos)

**Institutional capitulation:**
- **Christopher Wray** (FBI) - agreed to step aside rather than make Trump fire him
- **Several Democrats** - signaling willingness to work with Musk/Ramaswamy's DOGE

### The ABC Settlement Context

A jury found Trump civilly liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll. The judge clarified:
- Jury didn't find "rape" under NY criminal law (requires vaginal penetration by penis)
- Jury DID find forced digital penetration
- Judge wrote: "the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that" [rape as commonly understood]

Stephanopoulos said on-air Trump was "found liable for rape" - using the broader definition. Despite strong legal position, ABC settled.

### Explaining the Capitulation

Different motivations for different actors:

1. **Lack of stomach for fight** - Many simply don't want confrontation
2. **Sense of futility** - Believing resistance is pointless
3. **Welcoming the new order** - Tech leaders who "hated wokeness, resented demands of newly uppity employees, chafed at Biden's crypto/AI regulation attempts"
4. **Bipartisanship credit** - Democrats hoping to "steer DOGE" productively
5. **Reading the electorate** - Harris pollster warned DNC against "pearl-clutching" over cabinet picks

### The New Order

Marc Andreessen on X (representing the new ideology):
> "The individual has the intrinsic moral right to live his life in a special and fulfilling way without subordinating to the universal collective. Purveyors of abstract guilt must not steal that from you."

### Key Observation

> "Collectively, all these elite decisions to bow to Trump make it feel like the air is going out of the old liberal order. In its place will be something more ruthless and Nietzschean."

### Connection to NRx Framework

This "capitulation" is the practical manifestation of the accelerationist thesis:
- The "Cathedral" (media, institutions) is collapsing its resistance
- Tech billionaires aligning with post-democratic power structure
- Democratic norms becoming optional for those with sufficient power
- The Nietzschean framing explicitly invoked by participants

## The Accelerationist Moment in American Politics (December 2024)

*Source: David Wallace-Wells, NYT Opinion (Dec 11, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/opinion/trump-tech.html*

### The Return of Futurity

Wallace-Wells argues that for nearly a decade (2015-2024), American politics lacked a positive vision of the future. Trump 2016 was reactionary nostalgia ("Make America Great Again"); Democrats responded that America was "already great." Biden's industrial policy was rhetorically backwards-looking despite substantive investment.

Now, thanks to tech oligarch influence, Trump returns carrying "the banner of a new futurity" - accelerationist in character.

### The Shift in Tech Support

**2016 vs 2024:**
- 2016: Only Peter Thiel openly campaigned for Trump; other CEOs reluctantly visited Trump Tower post-election
- 2024: "Many of Silicon Valley's titanic figures have been riding with Trump all along"
- Musk contributed $277M to Trump's campaign

**Notable quote from Jim Cramer:** "the best government money can buy"

### Andreessen's Post-Election Rhetoric

After the election:
- Called it "a boot off the throat"
- "Every morning I wake up happier than the day before"
- Described America as "an economic coiled spring" with "growth brutally suppressed since before I was born"
- Predicted US growth could double, triple, or quadruple with deregulation

### The Empirical Counterpoint

Wallace-Wells notes the disconnect from economic reality:
- US economy has been "lapping its peers for decades"
- Per capita wealth several multiples of China's
- 7 of 8 most valuable companies globally are American
- US stock market commands >60% of global capitalization (up from <40% in 2008)
- 8 of world's 10 richest people are American

Yet Andreessen frames this as evidence of suppressed potential.

### The Policy Agenda

Beyond standard tax cuts:
1. **Deregulation** as primary focus (not just tax policy)
2. **Jay Bhattacharya** (Stanford, Covid contrarian) to lead NIH - prioritizing "unapologetic risk-taking" in biomedical research
3. **CFPB** targeted by Andreessen (mischaracterized as protecting incumbent banks)
4. **Crypto/AI** as new frontiers with minimal existing regulation

**Trump on Bitcoin:**
- 2021: "just seems like a scam... potentially a disaster waiting to happen"
- 2024 campaign: promised "strategic national Bitcoin stockpile" and to make US "crypto capital of the planet"

### The Accelerationist Experiment

> "An accelerationist experiment is about to play out in government, through some mix of deregulation and kleptocratic patronage. We are all about to see what, exactly, that yields."

### Further Reading (Wallace-Wells recommendations)

- Jesse Singal on Andreessen's CFPB misrepresentation
- Zephyr Teachout on the death of Silicon Valley liberalism

## The Orbán Playbook: Software and Hardware of Autocratic Populism

*Source: Péter Krekó, POLITICO Magazine (November 2024)*
*https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/11/23/trump-autocrat-elections-00191281*

Hungarian parliamentarian and populism researcher Péter Krekó analyzes how modern autocracies are built from within democratic systems. Orbán has been called "Trump before Trump" (Steve Bannon); JD Vance cites him as an inspiration "we could learn from."

### The Software: Populist Narratives

Populism's opposite is elitism, which lacks appeal. Key narratives that generate consent:

**The Folksy Outsider**
- Pushing against norms establishes the leader as disrespected by liberal elites
- Performative working-class solidarity (Trump at McDonald's, ordering burgers in White House)
- Symbolic valorization of devalued working-class lifestyles

**Anti-Elitism**
- Universities as enemies (Orbán cracked down on them; Vance called them "the enemy")
- Escalating culture war against "liberal" institutions

**Anti-Immigrant**
- Intricate narratives about self-inflicted Western decline via "liberal virus"
- Activates racial stereotypes about both new immigrants and historical minorities

**Economic Nationalism**
- Tariffs and trade wars (mirrors Orbán's fight against economic globalization)
- Glorifies "makers" vs. "takers" - resonates with working-class values
- Crucially: cements alliance between plutocrats and workers (both portrayed as "hard-working value creators" vs. "lazy bureaucrats" and "benefit scroungers")
- The economic layer cushions core nativist ideas - many supporters respond to economic messages, not racial ones

**Why "Nazi" labeling fails:**
> "Labeling Trump and Orbán and their supporters as moral degenerates, or even Nazis, is tactically dysfunctional. Some of their voters are hardcore racists, but many aren't."

Successful populists unite:
1. Conservatives/nationalists with cultural grievances (anti-immigrant, anti-identity politics)
2. Working-class with economic frustrations (insecurity, stagnation)

### The Hardware: Institutional Capture

Once narratives take hold, incremental institutional changes build permanent power. Each step may be defensible alone; together they're formidable.

**Strengthen Executive Power**
- After losing office in 2002, Orbán resolved to be "much more aggressive" in consolidating power
- Project 2025 echoes this: dismantle "administrative state," strengthen executive
- Systematic removal of disloyal officials

**Discipline the Judiciary**
- Rein in Justice Department, influence judiciary
- Supreme Court already conservative; new appointments cement decades of control
- Vance mentioned "simply disobeying judicial authorities"

**Change Election Processes**
- Manipulate electoral rules and district boundaries (Orbán imported gerrymandering from US)
- Georgia example: Republicans increased power to change "fraudulent" results
- Proposed legislation to twist electoral process for future cycles

**Control the Media**
- Orbán used centralized propaganda, market pressure, loyal billionaires
- Murdoch empire + Musk/X + friendly tycoons
- "This mirrors Orbán's strategy to forge a strong alliance with the country's billionaires for mutual protection and support"

**Secure Control over Party**
- Replace mainstream leaders with loyal outsiders
- Trump co-opted Tea Party, placed allies at RNC, daughter-in-law as co-chair
- Uber-loyalist nominations force Republicans in Congress to bend

### The Antidote: What Opponents Can Do

**Silver lining:** US has more robust political system; democratic erosion unlikely to reach Hungarian levels soon. Window to act before lasting damage.

**Three resistance points:**

1. **The Courts** - First defense against brazen constitutional attacks, but limited:
   - Illiberal regimes operate within legal boundaries
   - Litigation often backfires, boosting "outsider fighting unjust system" image
   - "The fight against right-wing populism is primarily political"

2. **The Media** - Fight for pluralism and independence:
   - Need channels reaching non-metropolitan areas dominated by far-right sources
   - "Liberal-minded billionaires should not sit idly by as they did in Hungary"
   - Progressive influencers must compete on social media against Musk/Tate

3. **States and Cities** - Most important:
   - Cannot win without powerful social base throughout country
   - Fight for every seat and institution
   - Even in hard illiberal regimes (Turkey, Hungary), free cities provide organizational resources and alternative governance visions

### The Democratic Party's Path

**Structural changes needed:**

1. **Reconnect with working class** - Not enough educated moderate suburbanites for electoral majority
   - Build local organizational structures, especially labor unions
   - Popular mobilization on issues that matter to ordinary citizens (not just media freedom/democracy)

2. **Party financing** - Shift from corporate elite to small/micro-donations
   - Frees party from elite capture
   - Allows pushing popular reforms that elites oppose

3. **Left-populist economics** - Reclaim stolen populist messages:
   - Break pharma chokehold on healthcare
   - Fight inflation
   - Increase minimum wage
   - These are popular even with right-leaning swing state voters

4. **Symbolic class politics** - Avoid condescending intellectual image:
   - "In their free time, most Americans go to McDonald's and not to the opera"
   - Valorize working class, focus on lived experience not abstract aggregates

### The Core Lesson

> "Hungary's key lesson is you don't protect democracy by talking about democracy — you protect democracy by protecting people. Only a democracy that works for the people is sustainable."

This complements the NRx/accelerationist framework: while tech oligarchs pursue their "hardware" takeover (DOGE, regulatory capture), the populist "software" generates consent. Fighting the software requires economic populism from the left, not abstract appeals to democratic norms.

## Personal Account: Watching Orbán's Transformation

*Source: Kati Marton, NYT Opinion (November 30, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/opinion/trump-orban-hungary-journalists-persecution.html*

Kati Marton - author, journalist, and daughter of Hungarian journalists imprisoned by Soviet-era secret police - provides a firsthand account of watching Hungary's democratic promise collapse under Orbán.

### The 1989 Promise

Marton stood in Heroes' Square during the 1956 uprising leaders' reburial, watching a bearded, skinny 26-year-old Viktor Orbán demand:
- Free elections
- Soviet troop withdrawal
- Democratic governance

> "If we are sufficiently determined, we can force the ruling party to face free elections."

Marton later befriended Orbán - hosted him in New York, joined him at the opera. George Soros was present at one dinner (now vilified by Orbán's regime).

### The 2002 Turning Point

Defeated at the polls after one term as PM, Orbán "made sure that he would not be defeated again." Re-elected in 2010, he:
- Weakened the independent judiciary
- Gutted independent media
- Built a one-party state apparatus

### "Soft Autocracy"

Marton's characterization of Orbán's Hungary:
> "Dissidents and reporters aren't jailed; they are merely driven out of business and — in the case of thousands — out of the country."

This is the playbook Trump admires. As Trump said: "There's nobody that's better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orbán."

### Family History as Warning

Marton's parents were UPI journalists in 1950s Budapest, imprisoned for covering show trials:
- Father heard Dvorák's "New World" Symphony in his cell, drawing solace from America's existence
- Mother occupied a nearby cell, unknown to him
- Children left with paid strangers
- Father attempted suicide in prison

After accessing secret police files in 2005, Marton found that under brutal interrogation, "my parents did not compromise a single Hungarian citizen."

### The Personal Stakes

The article connects abstract democratic decline to lived experience:
> "No American child has yet had to open her front door, as I did in 1955, to face three secret policemen, disguised in workers' overalls, declaring, 'Your mother called about the meter. Go get her.'"

She notes Voltaire's warning about the connection between absurdity and atrocity - directly applicable to the current moment.

### Why This Matters

The personal account humanizes the Orbán playbook analysis. It demonstrates:
1. Authoritarians can start as genuine democrats (1989 Orbán was sincere)
2. The turn happens gradually, often after electoral defeat
3. "Soft autocracy" still destroys lives and forces exodus
4. Family history under totalitarianism shapes perception of warning signs
5. Americans with no such history may not recognize the patterns

## The Inverted Morality of MAGA (November 2024)

*Source: David Brooks, NYT Opinion (Nov 28, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/28/opinion/trump-values-maga-cabinet.html*

Brooks argues that Trumpism represents not just a political movement but an **alternative value system** with inverted moral judgments. Drawing on essays by Noah Millman and Damon Linker, he frames the core divide as **institutionalist vs. anti-institutionalist morality**.

### The Institutionalist View

In the institutionalist worldview:
- We are formed by institutions (families, schools, professions, government structures)
- Good character develops by living up to institutional standards of excellence
- We inherit, steward, and pass along institutions to the next generation
- Institutions have flaws but are fundamentally legitimate

Example: **Mitt Romney** - outstanding husband/father, successful businessman, served as Olympics head and governor, had courage to vote for impeachment. From institutionalist view: admirable.

### The Anti-Institutionalist (MAGA) View

From MAGA perspective, institutionalists are **lemmings** who:
- Shape-shifted through meritocracy to please teachers/bosses
- Serve fundamentally corrupt and illegitimate systems
- Enabled: financial crisis, Covid school closures, media/bureaucratic ruin

### MAGA Heroism

What does virtue look like in MAGA morality? The Trump cabinet nominees exemplify it:

**The virtuous MAGA man is:**
- Self-assertive, combative, transgressive, vengeful
- Not afraid to break rules, reaches his own conclusions
- Has contempt for institutions, happy to be a battering force
- Unbothered by elite scorn - revels in it, provokes it

**The moral inversions:**
- If the establishment sees you as sleazeball → doing something right
- If the legal system indicts you → must be virtuous
- Sexual assault accusations = feature, not bug (sign of "manly man")
- Scandal-shrouded nominees more trustworthy than honest people (no New York tell-all memoirs)

### The Autocrat's Preference for Corruption

> "The corrupt person owes total fealty to Donald Trump. There is no other realm in which he can achieve power and success except within the MAGA universe."

Autocrats prefer surrounding themselves with corrupt people because:
1. Easier to control
2. If necessary, easier to destroy

### The Transvaluation of Values

Damon Linker's formulation (quoted by Brooks):
> "Trumpism is seeking to advance a revolutionary transvaluation of values by inverting the morality that undergirds both traditional conservatism and liberal institutionalism. In this inversion, norms and rules that counsel and enforce propriety, restraint and deference to institutional authority become vices, while flouting them become virtues."

### The Coming Conflict

Brooks predicts "running conflicts between institutionalists and anti-institutionalists" - not just power struggles over:
- Justice Department
- Intelligence agencies
- Schools
- Democratic institutions

But also **values struggles** over what kind of person we should admire.

### Anti-Institutionalist Advantages

- Easier to degrade and destroy than preserve and reform
- Multidecade crisis of legitimacy (Oliver Stone left → Tucker Carlson right)
- Strong voices saying "everything is rotten"

### Institutionalist Counter-Arguments

**Character is destiny:** An administration of narcissists will be a snake pit - strife and scandal will undermine effective action. Running things is hard; changing things harder; rarely done well by solipsistic outsiders.

### The George Marshall Model

Brooks offers **George C. Marshall** (Army Chief of Staff, WWII) as the model institutionalist reformer:

**Marshall's ethic:** "I will never put my own ambitions above the needs of the Army or the nation."

Yet Marshall was **no standpatter**:
- Revolutionized Infantry School curriculum at Fort Benning
- Sent units on maneuvers without maps (real war has insufficient information)
- Shifted training toward mechanized warfare
- Spent career pushing against stifling traditionalism

### The Core Argument

> "Positive change will come from people who have developed a loving devotion to those institutions over years of experience, not people who despise them — the modern-day George Marshalls rather than the Pete Hegseths, Tulsi Gabbards and Robert F. Kennedy Jrs."

### The Question for the Next Generation

> "What kind of person do we want our children to become — reformers who honor their commitments to serve and change the institutions they love or performative arsonists who vow to burn it all down?"

### Connection to NRx Framework

This "transvaluation of values" language explicitly echoes Nietzsche - the same philosophical lineage as NRx/accelerationism. Brooks is describing the moral/cultural dimension of what the NRx theorists describe structurally: the replacement of democratic-institutional legitimacy with power-based legitimacy.

The institutionalist/anti-institutionalist frame maps onto:
- Cathedral vs. its destroyers
- Dynamists (who believe in institutional reform) vs. populists (who believe in institutional destruction)
- The "capitulation" phenomenon (institutionalists giving up)

## The Post-Cold War Era Is Finished. Liberalism Will Go On. (November 2024)

*Source: Ross Douthat, NYT Opinion (Nov 22, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/opinion/trump-liberalism-cold-war.html*

Douthat argues that Trump's 2024 re-election confirms we've definitively exited the post-Cold War era (1989-~2020), but offers two qualifications to his own sweeping claims.

### Qualification 1: End of Era ≠ End of Liberalism

John Gray (British philosopher, prophet of liberalism's doom) argues the transition will be a complete exit from liberalism - "systematically constructed and deeply embedded illiberal democracy" under Trump/Vance, European collapse into nationalism.

**Douthat's counter via Aris Roussinos:**

The post-1989 liberal order was qualitatively different from the post-WWII liberal order:
- **1989-2020**: Utopian in ambition, culturally comprehensive, imperious, imperial, hubristic, foredoomed
- **1945-1989**: Pragmatic, cold-eyed, bounded, less revolutionary

Eisenhower, LBJ, Reagan weren't "illiberal" in any everyday sense - they just operated within more bounded contexts than their post-Cold War successors, had preliberal/nonliberal instincts mixed in, related to the world less ideologically.

**The paradox**: A more bounded future may *save* liberals from themselves:

> "Just as the bipolar order of the Cold War world, by restraining liberalism's inherent tendencies to radicalization and hubris, made the Western world safe for a tempered and moderate liberalism, so may the multipolar world we have entered save liberals from their own excesses."

The post-Cold War order proved "disastrous for American liberalism" - a return to 1945-style actually-existing liberalism may be more sustainable.

### Qualification 2: American Democracy Looks Robust

Douthat has always been skeptical of full authoritarianism-in-America scenarios (cites Julian Waller's 2022 American Affairs essay).

**Two fears that Trump's 2024 win undermined:**

*Progressive fear (post-2016):*
- Archaic constitutional institutions enable right-wing minority rule
- Electoral College + Senate small-state advantage = permanent thwarted majority
- Constitution or democracy loses legitimacy

*Conservative fear:*
- Progressive "cathedral" uniting public/private power throttles free debate
- Mass immigration/demographic change makes national elections unwinnable for GOP

**By getting ~50% of popular vote, Trump undermined both:**
- Liberal conceit: his populism couldn't claim democratic legitimacy
- Conservative anxiety: elite institutions would shut populist right out

### The Electoral Rebalancing

Trump's 2024 coalition showed electoral self-correction at work:

**The shift in Republican votes:**
- 2016 votes concentrated in ways suited to Electoral College advantage
- 2024 gains distributed differently (more minority voters - Hispanic, Asian American)

**Consequences:**
- GOP Electoral College advantage has *diminished*
- Senate advantage has *shrunk*
- House: Republicans winning smaller majorities than popular vote would imply
- Plausible future: Democratic House majority becomes counter-majoritarian

This produces a genuine 50-50 country where House, Senate, and presidency are all consistently in play - *not* minority rule or one-party pseudo-democracy.

### The Open Questions

Trump's second term will reveal whether:
1. History brings us into an era defined by nationalist/populist synthesis (like post-1989 was defined by triumphant liberalism)
2. We're entering an "ideological interregnum" - a warring-states period with no clear heir

**Current assessment:**

> "The weirder, stranger future that we're entering still looks like a democratic future, with close contests for power notwithstanding the widening field of ideological debate."

### Connection to NRx Framework

Douthat's analysis offers a more optimistic counterpoint to the accelerationist thesis:
- While NRx theorists see post-democratic Caesarism emerging, Douthat sees democratic competition persisting
- The "capitulation" may not indicate permanent regime change but temporary accommodation
- Electoral rebalancing suggests the system adapts rather than locks in minority rule
- The return to "bounded liberalism" could be a stabilizing correction, not collapse

## Immigration Economics: The "New Right" Labor Argument

*Source: NYT Business/Economy (Nov 22, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/22/business/economy/immigration-trump-economy.html*

### The Core Argument

The intellectual movement behind immigration restriction (most closely identified with JD Vance and Oren Cass of American Compass) argues:

1. Cutting off vulnerable foreign labor will force employers to seek US-born workers
2. 2022-2023 immigration surge blunted inflation by filling positions - without it, employers might have offered better pay/benefits to bring Americans back
3. ~5 million prime-age men (25-54) not working represents untapped domestic labor force

**Vance quote:** "We cannot have an entire American business community that is giving up on American workers and then importing millions of illegal laborers... It's one of the biggest reasons why we have millions of people who've dropped out of the labor force."

**Oren Cass (American Compass):** "You can't seriously claim to care about worker power and simultaneously suggest that high levels of low-wage immigration are good for workers who are here."

### Historical Context

This position echoes historical Democratic stances:
- 1990s bipartisan commission (Clinton-appointed chair) recommended tighter immigration controls to protect workers without college degrees
- Bernie Sanders opposed 2000s immigration reform with guest worker expansion for same reasons

### The Economic Counter-Arguments

**Empirical research (post-2000s):**
- Recent synthesis: immigration has only "very slight negative impact" on less-educated native wages
- National Academies overview: modest negative effects only for earlier immigrants and teenagers
- Giovanni Peri (UC Davis): immigration had positive impact on US workers overall

**Why "more workers = lower wages" doesn't hold:**
1. Immigrants add demand for goods/services, creating jobs
2. Low-education immigrants take positions (meatpacking) that enable natives to move into supervisor/sales/accounting roles
3. Labor market complementarity, not pure substitution

### The Labor Union Evolution

**1980s-90s:** Unions backed restriction to protect American workers
**2000s onward:** Unions figured out organizing with immigrants was possible

SEIU (janitorial, healthcare) now fights for protections for unauthorized workers rather than exclusion. AFL-CIO backs commission to adjust immigration based on economic conditions (fewer visas in slowdowns, more when running hot).

**United Brotherhood of Carpenters position:**
- Campaigns against labor brokers that let contractors avoid liability for illegal employment
- But backs path to legal status rather than crackdowns
- Argues raids/deportations make immigrants less willing to stand up for rights, eroding standards for everyone
- "Our industry has always been an entry to the middle class for the immigrant work force"

### The "New Right" vs. Labor-Left Framing

**Economic Policy Institute (labor-funded):** The issue is employers using immigration to degrade wages, not immigrants themselves. Solution: more DOL enforcement of wage/hour laws (blind to immigration status), guest worker reforms that raise pay and allow job mobility.

**American Compass / New Right:** Wind down guest worker programs entirely, remove unauthorized immigrants, seal border.

### Why Mass Deportation Won't Solve Labor Force Dropout

Among non-working prime-age men without college degrees:
- Majority cite poor health or disability
- Mental health issues common
- Substance abuse plays a role
- Injuries from physical jobs, chronic conditions

**Richard Reeves (American Institute for Boys and Men):** "There are huge issues with their employability. It's not like, by getting rid of the other guys, suddenly employers will say, 'Oh, great, here's this reserve army of labor sitting there, raring to go.'"

### Connection to Dynamist-Populist Framework

This is a concrete policy manifestation of the Musk-Vance tension:
- **Dynamists** (Musk): Want skilled immigration (H-1B), see global talent as essential to competitiveness
- **Populists** (Vance): Want restriction across the board to tighten labor market for working class

The empirical economic research mostly favors the dynamist position on low-wage immigration (complementarity effects), but the populist narrative has political resonance with workers who feel labor market pressure regardless of the macro data

## The Post-Religious Right: A Taxonomy

*Source: Ross Douthat, NYT Opinion (May 10, 2024)*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/opinion/religion-republican-conservatives.html*

Douthat responds to the claim (from Compact magazine's Matthew Schmitz) that a "post-religious right" has "failed to materialize." While agreeing that Trump-era conservatism can have a religious face and that white-identitarian politics had less influence than expected, Douthat argues post-Christian conservatism is clearly more potent than 10-20 years ago.

### Key Data Point

Nonchurchgoing Republicans have grown substantially:
- 2008: 29% of Republicans reported "seldom" or "never" attending church
- 2022: 44% of Republicans report the same

Many remain "culturally Christian" - saying religion is important while not attending - but the multigenerational conveyor belt from nominal Christianity to "no religious affiliation" is well-documented.

### The Four Categories of Post-Religious Right

**1. Barstool Conservatism**

Matthew Walther's term (referencing Dave Portnoy's "Barstool Sports" empire):
- Voters who recoil from progressive moralism
- But retain liberal-to-libertine personal values that also made them recoil from conservative Christianity
- Anti-left and anti-woke without being socially conservative
- Accept: pornography, homosexuality, drug use, legalized gambling
- Examples: Midwesterners who swung to Trump over trade but would never vote pro-life in a referendum; Hispanic men attracted to Trump's businessman persona

**2. The Guru Class**

Right-leaning media personalities on YouTube/podcasts:
- Most influential ones are NOT Christian
- **Jordan Peterson / Joe Rogan**: Interested in biblical religion as part of Jungian/supernatural panoply, not as faith
- **Neo-Nietzschean wing**: Andrew Tate (lowbrow) to Bronze Age Pervert (highbrow)
- On the right because they're anti-woke, anti-liberal, anti-establishment
- Not religious conservatism by any reasonable definition

**3. Proto-Neoconservatism**

Dissidents from progressivism who came from mainstream liberal institutions:
- Still see themselves as defending liberalism against enemies left AND right
- Big, diverse, complicated group
- Some will never be right-wing; others basically already are
- Tension visible in Thomas Chatterton Williams's Atlantic profile of Walter Kirn
- Richard Dawkins vs. newly-Christian Ayaan Hirsi Ali debate at "Dissident Dialogues" conference illustrates religious fault lines
- Generally: respect religion as "social technology" without openness to actual belief
- "A long way to travel to constitute anything like a religious conservatism"

**4. The Silicon Valley Right**

Musk, Andreessen, Thiel, and others:
- Farthest from religion of all these factions
- Thiel is "heterodox Christian" but generally this wing is most secular
- Share with religious conservatives some belief in human exceptionalism (vs. full transhumanism)
- Ready to use "just about any means" to further dynamism (polyamory, artificial wombs for birthrate crisis)
- Few moral constraints that even a pro-growth Christian would consider necessary

### Musk + Trump = Shapes of Post-Christian Right

> "I think it's fair to say that Musk and Trump are the two most important figures on the contemporary American right-of-center, and between their respective personae you can see some of the shapes that a fully post-Christian right might take."

### The Open Question: Pre-Christian or Post-Christian?

Douthat leaves open the possibility that what looks post-religious might be pre-religious:
- Hirsi Ali's conversion as potential harbinger
- "Surprising rebirth of belief in God" among heterodox intellectuals
- Peterson, Rogan, even Musk or Dawkins could "swim in the sea of faith"

But pending that eventuality, religious conservatives must constantly negotiate relationships with these factions, facing temptations to mute convictions for anti-left solidarity.

### The Abortion Dilemma Example

Religious conservatives' current abortion dilemma illustrates the tension:
- Their political leader (Trump) "cannot really be taken seriously as a spokesman for the pro-life cause"
- They face constant temptation to sacrifice convictions for coalition unity

### Connection to Other Sections

This taxonomy enriches the earlier analyses:
- **Dynamist-Populist** (Musk vs. Vance): Both can be post-religious or religious; the axis cuts across belief
- **Capitulation**: Tech leaders' alignment with Trump reflects the Silicon Valley right's secular pragmatism
- **Orbán Playbook**: The "software" (populist narratives) can work regardless of religiosity
- **Inverted Morality**: The anti-institutionalist stance overlaps with but isn't identical to post-religious stance
