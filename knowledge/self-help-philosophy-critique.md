## "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Shitty Life" (Erik Baker, The Drift)

A historian's critique of the self-help philosophy genre—books that promise to help you "make peace with the reality that disappointment, frustration, and agony are inexorable parts of life."

### The Genre's Core Message

Self-help philosophy brands itself as an "antidote" to toxic positivity and unrealistic expectations. Key figures:

- **Mark Manson** - *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck*, *Everything Is Fucked*
- **Ryan Holiday** - Pop-Stoicism empire (Daily Stoic, *The Obstacle Is the Way*, etc.)
- **Oliver Burkeman** - *Meditations for Mortals*, "The Imperfectionist" newsletter

Their shared advice: Accept limits on your control, moderate expectations, question assumptions about what matters. "We make ourselves miserable by worrying about stuff we can't affect."

### The Critique

**It's not as subversive as it claims:**
> "If all this advice really cuts against the grain of the modern world... the fact that, in various incarnations, it has proven so popular (and so lucrative) for so long is a bit of a puzzle."

It's less an "antidote" to positive thinking and more its "Janus face"—looking back serenely at hopes society raised and crushed.

**Pop-Stoicism's platitudes:**
> "Of things some are in our power, and others are not."

Baker notes this is "so platitudinous that its primary effect is neither to enlighten nor to corrupt, but simply to bore."

**The political risk:**
Quoting Marcuse: "It would suit those in power to know that those they have made anxious... are content to wallow in their anxiety and not take any action to reform the material conditions that brought it about."

### Historical Context

The genre has roots in:
- **New Thought** (Gilded Age) - material obstacles are illusory, overcome through proper focus
- **Midcentury occultism** - astrology, flying saucers, Jungian collective unconscious
- **1960s-70s counterculture** - Zen, existentialism, homesteading, psychedelics
- **Alan Watts, Robert Pirsig** - blending Eastern philosophy with lifestyle advice

Stoicism spiked in the 1990s—not an era of complacent optimism but one where "forces determining social reality feel even more impersonal than before."

### The Better Books

Baker identifies authors who take the political critique seriously:

**Kieran Setiya** (*Life Is Hard*) - Uses Frankfurt School ideas but argues "there is value in a single step toward justice."

**Avram Alpert** (*The Good-Enough Life*) - Unlearning "greatness" expectations can prevent burned-out organizers. Manson's advice is "pretty good" but must include appreciation for structural forces.

**Samir Chopra** (*Anxiety*) - Directly presents Marcuse's critique. "Socially manufactured anxiety... can and should be redressed. Combating and confronting anxiety requires acceptance, activism, and contemplation."

### The Central Tension

> "The question, then, is what the proper blend looks like."

Baker's personal realization:
> "I was spending more of my time thinking about my own despair than about the problems outside myself that were supposedly fueling it."

The trap of over-acceptance:
> "With enough practice tolerating imperfection you can learn to forget what it is you're failing to live up to. When those expectations include owning a vacation home or winning a Nobel Prize, letting go might be healthy—but doing so is tragic when they include stopping a genocide or ending homelessness."

### Key Insight: Collective vs. Individual Agency

> "Any reality made by human beings can be remade by them. The price of this power is mutual obligation: we can never let ourselves off the hook."

The positive-thinking cliches are true **in the first-person plural**:
- **We** are responsible for how our lives unfold
- **We** can do things that seem impossible
- But this requires "acting through structures that are bigger than any of us alone"

> "What we do with our lives does matter—as much as anything possibly could. That should keep us up at night."

### Practical Takeaways

1. **Don't use acceptance as an excuse** - Distinguish between existential limits and socially manufactured constraints
2. **Collective action expands your sphere of control** - Things that seem beyond individual control aren't beyond collective control
3. **Watch for the self-focus trap** - If you're spending more time processing your despair than addressing its causes, recalibrate
4. **Both optimism and resignation can be self-indulgent** - The point is engagement, not comfort
