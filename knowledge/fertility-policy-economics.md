# Fertility Policy & Economics

Research and policy analysis on global fertility decline, from Zvi Mowshowitz's "Fertility Roundup #4" (Dec 2024).

## Key Economic Findings

### The $300k Number

Two independent analyses converged on the same cost estimate for subsidized births:
- **Car seat regulation study**: ~$270k-286k per additional birth (in 2024 dollars)
- **Childcare regulation study**: ~$300k per additional birth

These numbers suggest **$300k in direct subsidies or equivalent cost reductions** would yield roughly one additional birth in the US.

### Liquidity Matters More Than Total Value

Studies on IVF willingness-to-pay found **at least 40% of response** comes from liquidity effects. Implications:
- $10k spread over time ≈ $6k paid at birth
- Front-loaded, lump-sum payments are far more effective per dollar
- Tax breaks paid later are much less impactful than cash on delivery

### The Motherhood Penalty Is Smaller Than Perceived

Danish IVF study found:
- Women whose IVF succeeded took a large earnings hit in Year 1
- Recovery starts Year 2, break-even by Year 10
- **2% higher lifetime earnings** than unsuccessful IVF group
- Perception of permanent penalty may be suppressing fertility more than the actual penalty

## Policy Analysis

### What Works

1. **Direct cash payments** - especially lump-sum at birth
2. **Marriage incentives** - family policy clearly boosts marriage rates
3. **Reducing childcare regulation** - Connecticut→Louisiana regulations = +13% TFR
4. **Covering IVF** - lowest hanging fruit for infertile couples
5. **Status/cultural shifts** - Israel's integration of Orthodox communities normalizes high fertility

### What Doesn't Work (As Designed)

- **Hungary's 5% GDP spend**: Only 1-2% was new spending; structured as tax breaks that help wealthy, not those most price-sensitive
- **Paid sick leave**: Actually *decreases* fertility (possibly signals career damage to women)
- **Small percentage-of-GDP programs**: South Korea's 1% GDP did little

### Tax Policy Proposals

Bryan Caplan's graduated income tax adjustment:
- +50% for 0 kids
- 0% for 1 kid
- -20% for 2 kids
- -40% for 3 kids
- -60% for 4 kids
- -80% for 5 kids
- -100% for 6+ kids

Would be expensive but effective. Needs caps to prevent gaming by ultra-wealthy.

## The Iron Law of Wages (Extended)

Classic: Wages tend toward minimum necessary to sustain life.

Modern twist: **The minimum necessary to sustain life tends toward wages.**

Mechanisms:
- Regulatory requirements to purchase more/better goods
- Artificial scarcity (housing, education)
- Status competition escalation
- Cultural expectation shifts

Result: As productivity rises, so do perceived costs of children, creating a trap.

## Country-Specific Notes

### South Korea
- 80% of young people call it "hell"
- 75% want to leave
- Dog strollers outselling child strollers
- Worst of both worlds: modern challenges + traditional expectations
- Proposed $70k baby bonus being considered

### Israel
- High fertility even among secular
- Theory: Orthodox communities integrated enough to be aspirational
- Status of high-fertility subcultures raises status of high fertility generally

### Japan
- 9 million vacant homes
- 1/3 of unmarried adults 20-49 have never dated

### China
- 2.2 working-age adults per dependent until 2030 (as good as Japan ever achieved)
- Projections show stabilization around 2055, but this is optimistic

## Childcare Regulation Impact

Moving from highest regulation (Connecticut) to lowest (Louisiana):
- TFR rises from 1.51 to 1.70 (+13%)
- If every state → Louisiana level: ~5% fertility increase
- Each 1-point increase (0-10 scale) costs parents $6k-$13k per child needing care

## Urbanization & Housing

- Fertility and urbanization correlation: -0.48 nationally
- High-rises correlate with low fertility, but causation is through **space cost**, not building type
- Living with parents predicts -0.04 fertility per year of cohabitation

**Housing theory**: The issue isn't density—it's that South Korean high-rises don't allocate space for families. Double the high-rises with larger units at lower prices, and the penalty disappears.

## Cultural/Perception Factors

- American women: only 14% concerned about fertility decline
- Men more concerned (30%) but not enough to act
- Younger/more liberal even less worried
- Until concern rises dramatically, solutions capable of working won't be tried

### The "Baby Simulators" Finding

High school programs designed to reduce teen pregnancy by making kids experience childcare difficulty **actively backfired**. Drawing attention and thought to the question of children may increase fertility.

## The Biological Clock Problem

Many people don't appreciate the timeline constraints. Health class should emphasize this as the single most important practical knowledge.

Example from article: 35-year-old unmarried woman wants 4 children, says she's "taking it slow" with her relationship.

## Takeaways

1. **Money works**, but must be structured correctly (lump-sum, front-loaded)
2. **Perception management matters** - motherhood penalty is smaller than believed
3. **Status/cultural levers** may be cheaper than direct subsidies
4. **Deregulation** (childcare, au pairs, housing) can be high-impact
5. **We are not trying hard enough** - most interventions are far below effective threshold

## Deep Dive: Car Seats as Contraception

From the full original study analysis by Zvi Mowshowitz.

### The Mechanism

Car seat laws reduce births because **most cars cannot fit three car seats in the back seat**. Women with two children younger than their state's age mandate have a 0.73 percentage point lower annual birth probability (7.8% relative drop).

Effect only appears for:
- Third child births specifically
- Households with car access
- Households with a male present (both front seats occupied)

### Non-Linear Age Effects

The constraint years bound has huge non-linear impact on lifetime third-child probability:
- 4-year mandate: ~0.32% reduction
- 8-year mandate: ~4.48% reduction (14x worse)

An 8-year law is not 2x worse than a 4-year law—it's **14x worse** for fertility.

### Safety Evidence Is Weak

Key findings:
- Levitt (2008): "No apparent difference in the two most serious injury categories for children in child safety seats versus lap-and-shoulder belts"
- Since 1975, fatality rates dropped 77% for infants, 75% for ages 1-3, but only 52% for ages 4-8 and 49% for ages 9-12—suggesting benefits are concentrated in 0-3 range
- Studies claiming benefits for older children have insufficient controls for the common cause that parents who voluntarily use car seats for older kids are also more safety-conscious in unobserved ways

### The True Cost Calculation

Breaking down what car seat requirements cost families:
- New minivan cost (after trade-in): ~$15,000
- Reduced fuel efficiency over years: ~$3,000
- Non-monetary costs (stigma, hassle): ~$9,000
- **Total: ~$30,000 per affected family**

Since a $30k "tax" reduces fertility by ~10% in affected families, this implies:
- **$270,000 per prevented birth**
- Which almost exactly equals the cost of raising a child to 18 ($286k in 2022 dollars)

### Policy Recommendations

First-best solutions (in order):
1. Eliminate all car seat requirements beyond age 2
2. Failing that, limit to age 4 (captures most safety benefits, eliminates 80-90% of negative effects)
3. Failing that, exempt any child with two younger siblings present in the car

The rule that children ages 4-8 need car seats is "flat out nuts" from a cost-benefit perspective.

### Broader Implications

The car seat case demonstrates:
1. Regulations can have massive unintended costs on families
2. Regulators don't do cost-benefit analysis that includes family burden
3. There's regulatory capture (car seat makers, minivan manufacturers benefit)
4. Front-loaded costs have outsized impact on fertility decisions
