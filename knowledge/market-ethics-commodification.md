# Market Ethics and Commodification

Philosophical perspectives on when market transactions are ethically acceptable.

## The Commodification Spectrum

From acceptable to controversial to abhorrent:
- Hair sales → generally acceptable
- Kidney sales → controversial (could save lives but exploits desperation)
- Baby sales → near-universally rejected

## Key Tensions

**Need vs. Supply**: Paying for organs would increase availability and save lives, yet feels morally troubling because donors would likely be economically desperate.

**Simple Rules Fail**: Libertarian principles like "consenting adults should arrange their own affairs" collapse under real-world scrutiny. Example: Netherlands' legalized sex work hasn't eliminated coercion problems.

**The Desperation Problem**: If people only sell body parts due to financial desperation, paying for them might "calcify" inequality rather than address root causes. But taken to extremes, this "the worse the better" logic becomes absurd.

## Conclusion

"Rules and slogans are weak. The action is in details."

Policy requires nuanced case-by-case analysis rather than absolute principles, with careful attention to implementation specifics and real-world consequences.
