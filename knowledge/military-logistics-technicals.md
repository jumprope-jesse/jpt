A military historian's analysis of vehicle warfare logistics, using Mad Max as a case study. The insights apply broadly to understanding military vehicle choices and resource-constrained warfare.

## Core Principle

"Amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics."

The viability of any military system depends on sustainable resource consumption (fuel, ammunition, spare parts) relative to production capacity.

## Tactical Realities of Vehicle Combat

### Firing on the Move
- Extremely difficult without modern stabilizers
- WWII-era tanks with basic stabilizers had ~7% hit probability at 1000 yards while moving vs 97% stationary
- Report conclusion: ammunition cost of firing on the move "is largely wasted"
- Practical implication: vehicles must halt to fire effectively

### Armor Weight Tradeoffs
- Steel plate to stop rifle rounds: ~1/2 inch thickness
- Aluminum armor (M2 Bradley, M113): 1+ inch
- Weight premium for "can resist small arms": M113 is 13.6 tons, BTR-80 is 15 tons
- Heavier vehicles need more powerful engines = worse fuel efficiency

## Why Technicals Dominate Low-Resource Warfare

A "technical" is a militarized civilian vehicle, usually a pickup truck with mounted weapons.

### Advantages
1. **Fuel efficiency** - Toyota Hilux: 25 mpg vs HMMWV: 8 mpg vs M1 Abrams: 0.6 mpg
2. **Common parts** - Toyota sold 17.7 million Hilux units (350k/year) vs 281k HMMWVs total (10k/year)
3. **Easy maintenance** - Can be repaired by local mechanics
4. **Payload flexibility** - 1,500lb bed capacity supports machine guns, mortars, autocannons, ATGMs
5. **Combat versatility** - Can function as improvised APC, IFV, or self-propelled gun

### Platform Comparison (from article)

| Vehicle | MPG | Tank (gal) | Range (mi) | Payload (lbs) |
|---------|-----|------------|------------|---------------|
| Toyota Hilux | 25 | 22 | 550 | 1,540 |
| Ford F-150 | 18 | 26 | 468 | 2,000 |
| HMMWV | 8 | 25 | 300 | 2,500 |
| Deuce-and-a-Half | 10 | 50 | 500 | 5,000 |
| M1 Abrams | 0.6 | 504 | 265 | N/A |

### Why Motorcycles Are Bad for Combat
- High MPG but minimal cargo/passenger capacity
- Combat power: one person with small arms
- Better to load bikes on a truck for transport, then use for scouting/courier work

## Historical Example: The Great Toyota War (1986-87)

Chad defeated a Libyan invasion using primarily technicals (Hilux and Land Cruisers) despite Libya having conventional tanks and aircraft. Success factors:
- Operational mobility in sparse terrain
- French air cover neutralized Libyan aircraft
- Note: Technical-based armies typically lose badly against conventional forces

## Warfare Model Framework

Useful for analyzing fictional or real military systems:
- **Strategic model**: What aims are pursued and how?
- **Tactical model**: How does battle actually work?
- **Logistical model**: How are forces sustained?

Key questions:
- What resources drive conflict? (fuel, ammunition, food, water, spare parts)
- How are resources distributed? (concentrated vs dispersed)
- What's the sustainment vs consumption balance?

## Applications

This framework is useful for:
- Analyzing military history
- Understanding asymmetric warfare
- Evaluating fictional military settings
- Thinking about resource-constrained engineering decisions (the "technical" mindset: use common, robust, maintainable tools)

## Related Concepts

- "Simple, robust machines over custom exquisite systems"
- The value of commonality in parts and expertise
- Operational range vs strategic sustainability
- Prestige display through capability demonstration

# Imperial Military Doctrine & the "Republic of Princes"

A historical framework for understanding the Galactic Empire's military evolution, with broader applicability to analyzing empires and organizational centralization.

## The Republic of Princes Model

The Old Republic was not a democracy of people but a **republic of states** (analogous to Holy Roman Empire "princes"):

- Member states could be any form of government (Trade Federation, democratic Naboo, monarchic Alderaan)
- Each "prince" was internally self-governing with own military and resource base
- Central government ruled through/with the princes, not over them

**HRE Parallel**: Imperial states included noble rulers, prince-archbishops, abbots (Imperial prelates), grandmasters of holy orders, and free cities—diverse governance forms united under imperial membership.

## Doctrine Shift: Clone Wars → Empire

**Clone Wars doctrine**: Republic fleet built around fast carriers (Venators) and fighters; CIS had specialized gunboats

**Imperial doctrine**: ISD is gun platform first, carries own fighter screen but expects to win with primary battery

### Why the change?

Post-war context differs from peer conflict:
1. **No peer adversary** - War is over; now managing simmering princely tensions
2. **Escalation dominance** - Ships designed to intimidate planetary navies into compliance without fighting
3. **Counter-insurgency focus** - Hit-and-run rebels require force protection

The ISD as **Space-MRAP**: Prioritizes crew protection over mission accomplishment, avoids embarrassing weekly loss reports of smaller ships picked off by rebels.

## The Centralization Trap

Palpatine's project: centralizing power at expense of princes

**Two reaction vectors**:
1. **Princely discontent** (Bail Organa, Mon Mothma) - ruling class loses autonomy
2. **Popular discontent** - direct imperial rule exposes citizens to one law/custom, overriding local traditions

The princes co-opt popular movement into Rebel Alliance, promising restoration of "traditional liberties and customs."

## The Alderaan Gambit

Imperial fatal move (0 BBY):
- Beheading one prince as example to others
- Disbanding Senate, abolishing princely rule
- Relying on Death Star to keep princes in line during transition

**Historical parallel**: Ferdinand II marching into Bohemia/Palatinate (1618-19), triggering general revolt of princes → Thirty Years' War

**Critical failure**: Losing Death Star immediately meant the intimidation asset vanished while the provocative act remained.

## Military-Tributary Empire Collapse Pattern

"An army can intimidate many enemies, but it can only fight one."

Once potential force becomes deployed violence:
- Intimidation value collapses
- Other actors recalculate toward balancing (not bandwagoning with hegemon)
- Requires bedrock legitimacy to maintain control—which centralization had eroded

**Timeline**: 20 years of slow centralization (Clone Wars → Yavin), then just 5 years to collapse (Yavin → Endor).

## Doctrinal Mismatch at Endor

- **Rebels**: Fast-carrier doctrine (learned from Clone Wars peer conflict)
- **Empire**: Stuck with Space-MRAPs designed for intimidation and COIN

Emperor's **Dien Bien Phu gambit**: Lure rebels into conventional battle expecting decisive victory. Discovers balance not as lopsided as hoped.

## Post-Endor Fragmentation

Standard dynasty-ending pattern:
- "Emperor bungled strategy, unwilling to change course, assassinated by close associates loyal to empire but not emperor"
- Imperial forces fragment rather than coalesce around new leader
- Princes reestablish Republic with some retained central elements (unified military)

## Framework for Analyzing Military Systems

Three-model approach:
1. **Strategic model**: What aims, how pursued?
2. **Tactical model**: How does battle work?
3. **Logistical model**: How are forces sustained?

## Organizational Insights

Applicable beyond military contexts:

- **Escalation dominance** can backfire when the intimidating asset is lost
- **Centralization** creates efficiency but erodes local legitimacy
- **Force protection** priorities may undermine actual mission accomplishment
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Empire stuck with expensive MRAPs when doctrine needed to shift
- **Hegemony requires either legitimacy or overwhelming force**—centralization often destroys the former before the latter is ready
