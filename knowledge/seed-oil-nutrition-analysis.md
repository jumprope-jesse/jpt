Comprehensive skeptical analysis of the claim that seed oils (soybean, canola, sunflower, etc.) are a primary cause of modern health problems. Useful example of applying rigorous critical thinking to popular nutrition claims.

## The Claims Being Examined

Seed oil theorists argue:
1. Seed oil consumption correlates with obesity epidemic
2. Seed oils are highly processed (unlike traditional fats)
3. Some RCTs show negative outcomes with seed oils
4. Plausible mechanisms exist (inflammation via linoleic acid, omega-6:3 ratio, etc.)

## Key Counterarguments

### 1. Meta-Analyses Favor Vegetable Oils

Cochrane meta-analysis of RCTs found replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat:
- 21% reduction in cardiovascular events
- Small (non-significant) reductions in mortality
- Slightly better cholesterol profiles
- Average 1.8 kg weight loss

Individual studies (Sydney Diet Heart, Minnesota Coronary Survey) that show negative results are already included in these meta-analyses.

### 2. Correlation ≠ Causation

- Obesity rates may have started increasing in 1920s, before major seed oil consumption
- Inter-country data shows obesity correlates more strongly with GDP than omega-6 consumption
- Many confounders: seed oils are in processed foods, which have other problems

### 3. Proposed Mechanisms Are Unconfirmed

- Linoleic acid → arachidonic acid pathway saturates at low consumption levels
- Meta-review found "virtually no data" supporting inflammation claims
- Trials varying LA intake by up to 600% showed minimal effect on arachidonic acid levels

### 4. Theory Has Unfalsifiable Features

- Multiple variants (all vegetable oil? just seed oil? linoleic acid? omega-6:3 ratio?)
- "Nonlinear harm" - effects only past threshold, so negative results don't disprove
- "Can't un-ring the bell" - stopping won't reverse damage
- Focus on waistline vs. weight when weight doesn't change

### 5. Public Health Consensus

All G7 countries + WHO recommend limiting saturated fat. None endorse replacing vegetable oils with saturated fats.

## Reasonable Takeaways

**Weak version (reasonable):** Seed oils are processed; using cold-pressed olive oil instead is fine and possibly beneficial. Forces you to avoid processed foods.

**Strong version (indefensible):** Seed oils are THE cause of modern health problems. No rigorous path to this conclusion.

## What Actually Works for Diet

The author notes distraction risk - seed oil obsession may divert from proven strategies:
- Increase overall diet quality
- Eat fruits and vegetables
- Avoid processed food (especially processed meats)
- Eat low caloric density foods
- Avoid added sugar
- Avoid alcohol

## Methodological Lessons

1. Complex mechanistic arguments for diet have poor track record
2. Biology is spectacularly non-modularized - millions of interacting mechanisms
3. Any semi-plausible view can produce long citation lists
4. Look for meta-analyses over individual studies
5. Be wary of theories with built-in unfalsifiability

## Fat Science Primer

**Types of fatty acids:**
- Saturated: No double bonds (butter, coconut oil, animal fat)
- Monounsaturated: One double bond (olive oil, avocado oil)
- Polyunsaturated: Multiple double bonds (seed oils, fish oil)
  - Omega-6: Double bond at 6th carbon (linoleic acid)
  - Omega-3: Double bond at 3rd carbon (ALA, EPA, DHA)

**Trans fats:** Confirmed harmful. Created by partial hydrogenation or high-heat cooking with unsaturated oils. Stay below 200°C when cooking.

**Key insight:** Different oils have different compositions. Animal fats = mostly saturated + monounsaturated. Most vegetable oils = high polyunsaturated. Exceptions: olive/canola/avocado oil are high monounsaturated; coconut/palm oil are high saturated.
