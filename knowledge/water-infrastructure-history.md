## Key Insights

### Fresh Water Scarcity
- 97.5% of Earth's water is salt water
- Of the 2.5% fresh water, most is locked in polar ice or deep underground
- All easily accessible surface fresh water (rivers, lakes) would form a sphere just 35 miles in diameter

### Historical Water Systems

**Mohenjo-Daro (2600 BC)**
- 700 public wells, many 60 feet deep
- Intricate drain systems with settling pools for sediment
- Every house had bathing basins and toilets draining to public sewers
- Technology not surpassed for thousands of years

**Roman Era**
- Aqueducts channeled water from hills via gravity
- Cloaca Maxima carried waste to the Tiber River
- This "dump it downstream" model persisted through 19th century

**Johnny Appleseed's Role**
- Planted apple orchards primarily for hard cider production
- 5% alcohol killed bacteria/viruses
- Settlers drank cider because water was polluted by animal/human waste

### The Great Stink (1858)
- London's cholera epidemics (1832-33, 1848-49, 1853-54) killed thousands
- John Snow traced 1854 outbreak to contaminated well
- Hot weather in 1858 caused sewage to pile up on Thames banks
- Parliament finally forced to act when smell overwhelmed the building

### Modern Water Treatment

**Three-stage process:**
1. **Primary treatment** - settling tanks remove solids (updated Mohenjo-Daro method)
2. **Secondary treatment** - Fowler, Ardern & Lockett (1913) invented activated sludge process: bacteria consume organic matter in aerated water, then sink for reuse
3. **Tertiary treatment** - filtration, chemical treatment, UV radiation, membrane filtering for potable water

**Key innovation: Separating storm water from sewage** (British royal commission, 1898-1915)

### Current Challenges

**Global:**
- 2 billion people lack reliable clean water
- 40% of wastewater dumped without safe treatment
- 24% dumped with no treatment at all
- ~1 million deaths/year from bad water

**US specific:**
- 150,000 public drinking water systems
- 16,000+ public wastewater treatment systems
- Almost 500,000 miles of pipe nearing end of useful life
- EPA estimates $1.2 trillion needed over 20 years
- All 50 states have systems with lead pipes

**Desalination limitations:**
- Carlsbad, CA plant cost $1 billion
- Uses energy of a small town
- Produces 50M gallons brine waste daily
- Not scalable solution for most places

### The Governmentality Problem
The biggest obstacle isn't technical—it's "corruption, inefficiency, incompetence, and indifference":
- English cities lose 20% of water to leaks
- Pennsylvania cities lose ~25%
- Brazilian cities lose 35%+
- India's water contamination costs 2% of GDP in diarrhea treatment
- Texas leaks enough water to supply all its major cities

Systems historically only get fixed after disasters, despite decades of warnings.
