# US Road Infrastructure Quality

Source: "How Good Are American Roads?" by Brian Potter, Construction Physics (Nov 2024)

## Key Findings

- **US interstates are high quality**: 80%+ rated good or very good, only ~3% poor
- **Urban roads are poor**: 35%+ of non-interstate urban roads are poor quality or worse
- **Interstate quality improving over 30 years; non-interstate flat**
- Limited international data suggests US isn't a huge outlier, but comparisons are difficult

## Road Quality Measurement: IRI

**International Roughness Index (IRI)**: Measures vertical car movement per distance traveled
- Units: inches/mile or mm/meter
- Lower = better (less bounce)
- "Good" threshold: ~95 inches/mile / 1.5 mm/m

## US Road Quality by Type

| Road Type | Good or Better | Poor or Worse |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Interstate (all) | 80%+ | ~3% |
| Non-interstate rural | ~45% | ~15% |
| Non-interstate urban | ~35% | ~35% |

## Data Coverage
- Quality data exists for ~800,000 miles (19% of 4.3M total US road miles)
- Includes all Interstate System + National Highway System + other major roads
- 1M+ miles of unpaved roads not measured

## State Variation

**Best non-interstate roads**: Rural states (North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota)
**Worst non-interstate roads**: California, New Mexico, Louisiana

Surprisingly, climate (freeze-thaw, road salting) shows little correlation with quality.

## City Road Quality (Worst to Best)

**Worst**: San Francisco, Los Angeles (60%+ poor)
**Best**: Atlanta, Minneapolis (<10% poor)

13 of 19 largest US metros have >1/3 poor roads.

## International Comparison

Limited data available. US interstates compare favorably to national highways in UK, Netherlands, Ontario, Ireland. US non-interstates roughly comparable to British national roads.

**Quality standards comparison**: US has stricter thresholds than most countries for what counts as "good" road quality.

**European practices**:
- More frequent resurfacing (Dutch highways resurfaced more often than UK)
- 1992 US delegation found "serious deterioration that exists on US highways was virtually never seen in Europe"
- Repairs made sooner before damage spreads

## Construction Methods

**Asphalt pavement**: Most common in both US (majority) and Europe (~90%)
- Max service life: ~20 years
- Lower upfront cost

**Concrete pavement**: More durable alternative
- Service life: 30-50 years
- Higher upfront cost
- Only 30% of German highways are concrete
- 80% of Dutch roads are multi-layer asphalt

1993 Michigan DOT experiment: German-spec concrete road (2 layers, gravel base, tighter joints) performed slightly *worse* after 20 years than Michigan-spec, despite 2x cost.

## Key Takeaways

1. US interstates are world-class
2. Urban roads, especially in California, are "shockingly bad"
3. Lack of international IRI data makes true comparison difficult
4. Maintenance frequency may matter more than initial construction quality
5. Climate impact on road quality is less significant than expected
