# The Conflict Thesis: A Historical Myth

The "Conflict Thesis" (also called the Draper-White Thesis or Warfare Model) claims that science and religion have been perpetually at war throughout history. Despite being widely accepted in popular culture, **actual historians of science have rejected it for over 50 years** as simplistic, misleading, and factually wrong.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The thesis was created by religious believers** - John William Draper (1874) and Andrew Dickson White (1896) were trying to *save* religion from corrupt institutions, not attack it
2. **Their examples are largely false** - myths about the Church banning dissection, burning the Library of Alexandria, teaching flat earth, persecuting Galileo for science, etc. have been debunked
3. **The real history is complex** - religion and science have had relationships of conflict, cooperation, mutual influence, and indifference at various times
4. **Modern historians call this the "Complexity Thesis"** - John Hedley Brooke's *Science and Religion* (1991) is the landmark work

## Origin of the Myth

- **Draper** (1874): Methodist preacher's son who hated Catholic institutional bureaucracy, not religion itself
- **White** (1896): Episcopalian who co-founded Cornell University and was stung by religious opposition to its secular charter
- **Joseph McCabe** (early 20th c): Ex-Catholic priest who weaponized Draper-White for explicit anti-religious polemic
- These books became bestsellers and the thesis permeated popular culture

## Common Examples That Are Wrong

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| Church banned dissection | Church *sponsored* medieval institutions that practiced it (Mondino of Luzzi, c. 1275-1326) |
| Galileo tortured for heliocentrism | Never tortured; trial was political, not about science; Church astronomers confirmed his discoveries |
| Dark Ages killed science | Natural philosophy declined briefly after Rome fell but flourished in later Medieval period |
| Christianity opposed learning | 35+ lunar craters named after Catholic scientists; Jesuits led early modern astronomy |

## Why It Persists

1. **Confirmation bias** - fits anti-religious polemic needs
2. **Epistemological confusion** - people conflate "religion and science use different methods" (possibly true) with "they've always been at war" (historically false)
3. **Specific modern conflicts** (e.g., creationism vs. evolution) get projected backward onto all history
4. **Pop culture** - shows like Family Guy repeat the myth as comedy

## The Complexity Thesis

Modern historians (Brooke, Harrison, Numbers) argue:
- The categories "science" and "religion" as we understand them are *modern inventions*
- Before ~1850, natural philosophy, philosophy, and theology were intertwined enterprises
- Newton, Kepler, Galileo saw their scientific work as *motivated by* religious faith
- Religious institutions could be conservative *and* at the forefront of innovation

## Key Sources

- John Hedley Brooke, *Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives* (1991)
- Ronald Numbers (ed.), *Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion* (2009)
- Peter Harrison, *The Territories of Science and Religion* (2015)
- David Hutchings & James Ungureanu, *Of Popes and Unicorns* (2022) - popular audience
- James Hannam, *God's Philosophers* (2010) - medieval science

## Relevance

This is a good example of:
- **How persistent myths work** - emotionally satisfying narratives resist correction
- **The danger of "what everyone knows"** - popular consensus ≠ historical accuracy
- **Category errors** - confusing epistemological arguments with historical ones
- **The importance of actually checking sources** - even smart people (Sam Harris, Jerry Coyne) repeat debunked myths when they don't verify
