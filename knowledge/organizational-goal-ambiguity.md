# Organizational Goal Ambiguity and Bureaucratic Bloat

Source: Derek Thompson, The Atlantic (May 2024)

## Key Concepts

### Goal Ambiguity
A state of confusion or conflicting expectations for what an organization should do or be. When an institution has so many different jobs that it's hard to tell what its priorities are.

Example question: "What should I spend my time on: my next article, editing my lecture notes, doing a peer review, doing service, or advancing diversity? Who knows."

### Empire Building
Administrators are emotionally and financially rewarded for hiring more people beneath them. Those hires then want to increase their own status by hiring more people. Creates a human pyramid of bureaucrats taking on jobs of dubious utility.

### Mandate Inflation
More bureaucrats → new mandates for the organization → more hires needed → those hires request more responsibility → create new subgroups → even more mandates. A once-focused organization becomes anything but.

## Warning Signs
- Administrative positions growing faster than core function roles
- "Meeting World" - people spending most of their day in meetings of dubious value
- New oversight functions intruding on core work
- Organization struggles to articulate clear priorities
- Responses to crises reveal contradictions between stated values

## Consequences
- Rising costs (labor-intensive industries where compensation drives inflation)
- Power shifts from core practitioners to administrators
- Institutional incoherence becomes visible during crises
- Apparent hypocrisy when competing mandates collide

## Applicability to Tech
The same dynamics can occur in startups and tech companies:
- Non-technical roles can overshadow core engineering functions
- Process-heavy cultures emerge from unchecked bureaucratic growth
- "Bullshit jobs" proliferate when hiring is decoupled from mission
- Organizations that promise everything struggle to deliver anything well

## The Test
"If you took every third person with vice, associate, or assistant in their title, and they disappeared, would anybody notice?"
