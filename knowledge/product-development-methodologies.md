# Product Development Methodologies

Alternatives to Scrum for product development teams. Source: Department of Product survey + blog.

## ShapeUp (Basecamp)

6-week development cycles instead of 2-week sprints. Three phases:

1. **Shaping** - Designers, engineers, PMs examine problem space and flesh out solutions before committing
   - Design prototypes (rough, not perfect)
   - Engage engineering to gauge complexity
   - Identify assumptions
   - Write customer-facing pitch (like Amazon PR FAQ)
   - Set boundaries: what's NOT included

2. **Betting Table** - Investment decisions
   - "Bets, not backlogs" - no endless task lists
   - Stakeholders choose which shaped pitches to bet on
   - Unsuccessful bets get let go (can revive next round)

3. **Building** - 6 weeks to build something fully functional
   - Must include front-end AND back-end
   - Goal: working integrated functionality, not partial chunks

## Plan > Build > Ship

Lightweight waterfall. Each feature owned by engineer(s) from start to finish.

- **Plan**: Gather requirements, design solutions
- **Build**: Implement designs, iterate on feedback
- **Ship**: Deploy

Proponents argue there's still a place for waterfall-style development in certain contexts.

## GSD - Get Shit Done (Shopify)

Company-wide ethos, not just product methodology. Three phases:

1. **Think** - PMs, engineers, designers flesh out program from customer POV
2. **Explore** - Solutions developed, assumptions tested
3. **Build** - No more exploration, just execute

### Key differentiators:
- Internal tool (Vault) tracks all projects across all phases
- Anyone can search/track any project company-wide
- Stakeholder meetings discuss problems/questions, NOT status (status is in the tool)
- Projects over tasks mentality
- News feeds per project keep stakeholders updated

## When to Use What

| Methodology | Best For |
|-------------|----------|
| Scrum | Larger companies needing predictable release cadence |
| ShapeUp | Teams that believe meaningful work needs >2 weeks |
| Plan>Build>Ship | Feature ownership, clear start-to-finish accountability |
| GSD | Companies wanting radical transparency + execution culture |
| Kanban | Ultra-flexible, rapid direction changes |
