## Core Concept

Collins proposes that rituals—from religious ceremonies to casual conversations—function as **amplifiers of emotion**. A successful ritual generates collective excitement and motivation, while failed rituals drain energy and demoralize participants.

## Key Mechanisms

### Emotional Energy (EE)
Humans are "emotional energy seekers" who unconsciously gravitate toward situations that energize them and avoid draining ones. People don't experience these situations as controlling them—because they're being filled with energy, they feel in control.

### Micro-coordination
Rituals build emotional charge through synchronized physical activity: shared laughter, rhythmic chanting, coordinated movement. This entrainment creates shared emotional states among participants.

### Symbol Charging
Rituals invest objects and symbols with motivational power. A cross, flag, or idea becomes "sacred" by concentrating emotional energy from repeated collective focus. Crucially, **symbols decay without ritual reinforcement**—Collins suggests a weekly recharge cycle.

## Implications

- **Ritual precedes belief**: People join movements before developing coherent ideologies
- **Sacred/profane dissolves**: Any object can become sacred through successful ritual
- **Charisma is ritual success**: Political charisma emerges from ritual effectiveness, not inherent qualities
- **Co-presence matters**: Physical presence produces stronger ritual effects than digital interactions

## Applications to Leadership

- Team meetings, standups, and retrospectives are interaction rituals—their success depends on emotional energy generated, not just information exchanged
- Symbols (team names, logos, shared language) need regular ritual reinforcement to maintain meaning
- Culture is sustained through repeated successful rituals, not mission statements
- Remote work challenges ritual formation; intentional design of virtual rituals matters more
- The "vibe" of a team is measurable as collective emotional energy from successful interactions
