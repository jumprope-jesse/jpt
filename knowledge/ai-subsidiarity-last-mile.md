# AI and the Last Mile: Subsidiarity as a Design Principle

The principle of subsidiarity—push decisions to the lowest effective level—offers a framework for understanding AI's limitations and optimal deployment.

## The Concept

**Subsidiarity** (from Catholic social teaching, Pius XI's 1931 encyclical *Quadragesimo Anno*):
> It is "a grave evil and disturbance of right order" to transfer to larger organizations what "lesser and subordinate organizations can do."

Made operational in governance through the 1992 Maastricht Treaty—the EU should act only if objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states.

**Application to AI**: Most LLMs centralize enormous amounts of data through unified models, but struggle with local context, current information, and specific circumstances—not due to technical limitations alone, but because their architecture prioritizes patterns across vast datasets over preserving specific, local knowledge.

## The Last Mile Problem

AI's fundamental tension mirrors what subsidiarity was designed to address: centralized processing vs. local accuracy.

### Real Estate Example

A Zillow app might report that the Victorian on Maple Street is an "excellent value" based on square footage, lot size, and comps. But it doesn't know:
- The neighbor's garage band practices death metal every Sunday
- The coffee shop across the street has been sold to a skateboard park developer

The local realtor who's sold houses there for twenty years knows: "trust me, you want the ranch house two blocks over."

### Other Domain Examples

- **Lending**: Community banks provided nearly half of small-denomination farm/business loans (FDIC 2012 study) despite holding only a small percent of banking assets—precisely because of "soft information" about borrowers and local market conditions
- **Hiring**: Harvard's 2021 "Hidden Workers" study found automated screening rejected millions of qualified candidates who didn't match predetermined criteria but could perform at high levels with training
- **Baking**: AI can optimize manufacturing to the microsecond but can't replicate the local baker adjusting sourdough for humidity, elevation, and whether regulars prefer crunchier crust this season
- **Gardening**: Software knows optimal plant spacing; the local nursery owner knows gardenias thrive in the town's odd microclimate despite what the zone map says

## The AI Paradox: Scale vs. Specificity

Companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI pursue ever-larger models while promising more "personalized" experiences. Their marketing promises local relevance through global reach.

**The paradox**: The larger these models grow, the more they necessarily abstract away from specific, granular details.

**The economic paradox**: As AI handles the standardized 85-95% of decisions better, the remaining "last mile" of human judgment becomes both:
1. **More valuable** (it's what differentiates outcomes)
2. **More difficult to scale** (you can't automate local knowledge)

Companies face an impossible choice:
- Build ever-larger models that still miss crucial local context, OR
- Develop expensive networks of human experts who can provide context but destroy AI's promised efficiency

## Lessons from the Catholic Church

The Church mastered both global scale and local knowledge over 2,000 years:
- Built a worldwide hierarchy AND
- Knew that parish priests (not Vatican officials) needed to handle marriages, counsel parishioners, decide whether to repair the church roof

**Key insight**: Some forms of knowledge and authority must remain local to remain legitimate.

## Research Support

Market data shows economic value in balanced approaches:
- Deloitte (2022, 2023), JPMorgan (2023) found organizations combining AI tools with local expertise saw the highest ROI
- Best practices: incorporating "neighborhood knowledge," preserving "human in the loop" decision-making for complex client interactions

---

## The Balance

Local authority can fail catastrophically when left unchecked (history, including Church history, shows this). Subsidiarity isn't about:
- Blind faith in local wisdom
- Unquestioning trust in centralized systems

It's about finding the level at which each decision best serves the common good.

**Optimal deployment**: Global AI systems enhance rather than replace local expertise. Big data informs but doesn't override human judgment.

## Implications for AI System Design

1. **Don't assume centralization is better** - Some decisions require local knowledge that can't be captured in training data
2. **Identify the "last mile"** - Which 5-15% of decisions require human judgment?
3. **Preserve local expertise networks** - They become more valuable, not less, as AI handles the standardized portion
4. **Design for hybrid systems** - AI + local human expert often beats either alone
5. **Accept economic trade-offs** - Pure AI efficiency sacrifices local accuracy; pure local expertise doesn't scale

## Connection to Other Frameworks

- **AI Automation Ironies** (`ai-automation-ironies.md`): Subsidiarity helps explain *which* tasks to keep with humans—those requiring local knowledge AI can't capture
- **Uneven Adoption** (`ai-uneven-adoption-thesis.md`): New companies might design around subsidiarity from the start; incumbents have embedded assumptions about centralization
- **Expert-Observer Paradox**: The people with local knowledge are the ones being displaced; preserving their expertise requires intentional design
