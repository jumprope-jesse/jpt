## Core Thesis

The most important AI customers will primarily be **new companies**, not incumbents. Traditional companies will struggle to incorporate AI (outside of whole-sale job replacement), while entities built around AI from the start will truly leverage its capabilities.

> "Everything that makes a company work today is about harnessing people — and the entire SaaS ecosystem is predicated on monetizing this reality; the entities that will truly leverage AI, however, will not be the ones that replace them, but start without them."

## The Digital Advertising Analogy

Thompson draws a parallel to how digital advertising disrupted traditional CPG/ad agency models.

### The Old Model (CPG + Ad Agencies)

- **Brands** created for cohorts/demographics (manufacturing at scale)
- **Ad agencies** aggregated relationships across media, charged commission
- **Conversion** happened at physical stores, constrained by shelf space
- P&G's value: scale in manufacturing, advertising, and shelf space

### The Digital Disruption

1. **Conversion point shifted**: Cash register → checkout page
2. **Organizing principle changed**: Cohorts → individuals
3. **Facebook's advantage**: Understanding consumers as individuals, not demographics

### Why P&G Pulled Back from Facebook (2016)

Facebook's targeting was built around individual consumers. But CPG companies:
- Needed mass reach, not individual targeting
- Had conversion points in physical stores, not online
- Required brand awareness, not direct response

**Key insight**: The disruptive technology wasn't better for everyone—it was better for companies whose business model aligned with individual-level targeting.

### Who Actually Won

- **New DTC brands** built around digital advertising from the start
- **Traditional advertisers** eventually adapted through:
  - In-house ad buying (P&G took most ads in-house)
  - Programmatic platforms for mass reach
  - Evolution as TV collapsed and platforms matured

**Timeline**: The truly traditional model stayed relevant "far longer than anyone expected"—adaptation took years.

## Applying This to AI Agents

### The Promise: AI as "Ammunition"

Thompson references Keith Rabois's barrels/ammunition metaphor:
- **Barrels**: People who can independently ship things
- **Ammunition**: Resources that barrels deploy

Most companies adding people don't get proportionally more done—you need more barrels.

**AI's promise**: AI agents (especially inference-time scaling models like o3) could be **ammunition**—given tasks and trusted to complete them at a good-enough rate.

### Why Traditional Companies Will Struggle

Just as P&G was unsuited for highly-targeted advertising, **corporations are unsuited for high-precision AI agents**.

The problem:
> "No matter how well-documented a company's processes might be, it will become clear that there are massive gaps that were filled through experience and tacit knowledge by the human ammunition."

Traditional companies:
- Built workflows around humans
- Captured institutional knowledge in people, not systems
- Have tacit processes that no documentation captures
- Invested in SaaS tools that monetize human seat licenses

### SaaS as the New Ad Agency

SaaS companies are to AI what ad agencies were to digital advertising:
- **Ad agencies**: Made money via commission on advertising (a proxy for sales)
- **SaaS companies**: Make money via per-seat licensing (a proxy for work done)

Both monetize proxies rather than the underlying value. Both are vulnerable when the underlying unit changes.

**The shift**: AI compute will be priced by value of task completed, not seats occupied—just as digital ads are priced by conversion, not CPM.

## Implications

### For Startups

**Opportunity**: Build without the human-centric assumptions incumbents carry.

> "The entities that will truly leverage AI...will not be the ones that replace them, but start without them."

New companies can:
- Design processes around AI capabilities from day one
- Avoid the "human ammunition" infrastructure costs
- Move faster without legacy workflow constraints

### For Enterprises

**Near-term**: AI adoption will be slow and awkward.
- Processes assume human judgment and tacit knowledge
- SaaS tools built for humans won't translate to AI agents
- Cultural resistance from existing "ammunition"

**Possible exception**: Whole-scale job replacement (like mainframes did) may work before partial augmentation.

### For SaaS Companies

**Existential risk**: Per-seat pricing doesn't survive the shift to AI ammunition.

If work is done by AI, not humans:
- No seats to license
- Value shifts to outcomes, not tools
- The cohort chart model (LTV from expanding seats) breaks down

### Timeline

Thompson suggests this plays out **slowly**:
- Traditional companies will retain advantages "far longer than expected"
- True AI takeover of enterprises takes years
- Adaptation will eventually happen, but not quickly

## Key Quotes

On the nature of the disruption:
> "The future may arrive but be unevenly distributed, and, contrary to what you might think, the larger and more successful a company is the less they may benefit in the short term."

On what's required:
> "What will become clear once AI ammunition becomes available is just how unsuited most companies are for high precision agents."

On the winners:
> "The most important AI customers will primarily be new companies, and probably a lot of them will be long tail type entities."
