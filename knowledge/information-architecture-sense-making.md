## Core Concepts

### Information vs Data vs Content
- Information is distinct from raw data or content
- Understanding this distinction is fundamental to organizing effectively

### Complexity Layers
- Every thing is complex
- Knowledge is complex
- Stakeholders are complex

### Intent & Language
- Intent is expressed through language
- Language is the material of intent
- Meaning can get lost in translation
- Reduce linguistic insecurity by defining terms clearly

## Practical Methods

### Face Reality
- Draw your mess - visualize the current state
- Diagram your reality
- Reality happens across channels and contexts
- Timescale matters
- Rhetoric matters

### Choose Direction
- Architecture comes before design
- Understand ontology (your ontology already exists)
- Create a list of words you say (and don't say)
- Define terms for outsiders
- Understand the past before moving forward

### Measure Progress
- Progress is as important to measure as success
- Use baselines to stay in touch with reality
- Use flags to indicate if headed in right direction
- Measurements have rhythm
- Fuzzy is normal - accept ambiguity

## Taxonomy Approaches

### Types of Classification
- **Exact classification** - costs flexibility
- **Ambiguous classification** - costs clarity
- Ambiguity hides in simplicity

### Taxonomic Structures
- **Hierarchical** - tree structures
- **Heterarchical** - networked structures
- **Sequential** - ordered progressions
- **Hypertexts** - bridge between taxonomies
- Most things need a mix of approaches

### Key Insight
"Sorting is easier than deciding how to sort"

## Working with Structure

- Identify facets (different ways to categorize)
- The way you organize things says a lot about you
- Adjustments are part of reality
- The sum is greater than its parts
- Argue about it until it's clear
- "If it isn't under the floorboards, it's a facade"

## Practical Wisdom

- Keep it tidy
- Be the filter, not the grounds
- "Hey, nice IA!" - said no one, ever (good IA is invisible)
- This is hard (acknowledge the difficulty)

## Applications

Useful for:
- Project management
- Family logistics
- Startup workflows
- Personal knowledge management
- Team communication
- Navigating professional and personal complexity
