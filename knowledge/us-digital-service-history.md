# US Digital Service History

The US Digital Service (USDS) was founded after the healthcare.gov crisis to bring technologists into federal government. An oral history project documents its origins from 2009-2015.

## Key Facts
- Over 700 technologists served across three presidential administrations
- Founded after healthcare.gov launch failures in 2013
- Reorganized and renamed to "US DOGE Service" on January 20, 2025

## Lessons from the Oral History
- Transformative change requires collaboration between technologists and government insiders with institutional knowledge
- Government environments are often "paralyzed by inertia" - positioning matters as much as technical skill
- The work is part of a 20+ year civic tech movement transcending any single organization
