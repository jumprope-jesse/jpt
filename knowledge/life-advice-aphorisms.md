## Dynomight: Things That Don't Work

A contrarian list of approaches that often fail despite seeming reasonable:

**Knowledge & Learning:**
- Tree-based knowledge organization (too rigid for messy reality)
- Graph-based knowledge organization (95% quit within a month - flexibility becomes a curse)
- Expecting people to follow written instructions (even with bold caps and high stakes)
- Nonfiction books - how much do we really retain?

**Problem-solving:**
- Doing math via pure symbol manipulation - eventually you have to actually think
- Trying to figure it all out ahead of time (prototyping often beats planning)
- Rewriting code from scratch (you'll just make new mistakes)
- Quality over quantity - a pottery class experiment: students told to make many pots produced better work than those told to make one perfect pot

**Communication & Relationships:**
- Arguing with people who strongly believe X - devastating evidence rarely changes minds
- Telling people something obvious is actually surprising
- Doing unto others as you would have them do unto you (others have different needs)
- Wanting to be liked
- Getting closure with your parents
- Fixing relationship problems by having a baby

**Life framing:**
- Thinking about your life like a movie - most good lives don't have compelling plots, and almost all have bad endings
- Waiting for the right time - "if you really want to do something, don't wait for some unspecified time when it's more convenient and then watch that time recede before you"

**On crisis:** When someone you care about is in crisis, don't let not knowing the right words stop you. You don't have to find the right words. No one expects you to. Probably they don't exist.

## Dynomight: Things That Actually Work

"Dogs, vegetables, index funds, jogging, sleep, lists, learning to cook, drinking less alcohol, surrounding yourself with people you trust and admire."

**On interfaces:** The best interface in history is the beginning of Super Mario Brothers. You just start.

**On dieting:** You can lose weight on any diet (carnivore, vegan, potato, whatever) because you eat less with fewer options. But you gain it back when options return. The only permanent solution is permanently changing your food environment. Or drugs.
