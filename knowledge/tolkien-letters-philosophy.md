# Tolkien's Letters: Philosophy and Worldview

Source: LessWrong compilation of highlights from "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien: Revised and Expanded Edition"

## Machinery, Power, and Evil

Tolkien sees technology ("the Machine") as fundamentally tied to the desire for power and domination:

> "The tragedy and despair of all machinery laid bare. Unlike art which is content to create a new secondary world in the mind, it attempts to actualize desire, and so to create power in this World... Labour-saving machinery only creates endless and worse labour."

The Machine and Magic are essentially the same:

> "By [the Machine] I intend all use of external plans or devices (apparatus) instead of development of the inherent inner powers or talents – or even the use of these talents with the corrupted motive of dominating: bulldozing the real world, or coercing other wills."

**Speed as the root of evil**: "The basic motive for magia – quite apart from any philosophic consideration of how it would work – is immediacy: speed, reduction of labour, and reduction also to a minimum (or vanishing point) of the gap between the idea or desire and the result or effect."

## Altruism as Evil's Origin

A counterintuitive theme - evil arising from good intentions:

> "The Enemy in successive forms is always 'naturally' concerned with sheer Domination, and so the Lord of magic and machines; but the problem: that this frightful evil can and does arise from an apparently good root, the desire to benefit the world and others – speedily and according to the benefactor's own plans – is a recurrent motive."

On Gandalf with the Ring:

> "He would have remained 'righteous', but self-righteous. He would have continued to rule and order things for 'good', and the benefit of his subjects according to his wisdom... Thus while Sauron multiplied evil, he left 'good' clearly distinguishable from it. Gandalf would have made good detestable and seem evil."

## Language and Philosophy

Tolkien believed language shapes thought in ways we don't recognize:

> "The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stones' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse."

> "Legends depend on the language to which they belong; but a living language depends equally on the 'legends' which it conveys by tradition."

On the "straightjacket of Modern English" - modern idiom can't express certain thoughts:

> "People who think like that just do not talk a modern idiom. You can have 'I shall lie easier in my grave'... But there would be an insincerity of thought, a disunion of word and meaning."

**Philology as escape**: "Philology is philosophy, because it lets you escape the trap of the language you were born with. Much like mathematics, humanity's most ambitious such escape attempt, still very much in its infancy."

## The Fall and Nostalgia

Tolkien's worldview is suffused with the sense of the Fall:

> "It is a fallen world, and there is no consonance between our bodies, minds, and souls."

> "There cannot be any 'story' without a fall – all stories are ultimately about the fall – at least not for human minds as we know them and have them."

Two distinct emotions in his writing:
1. "The heart-racking sense of the vanished past" (what drew people to his work)
2. "The more 'ordinary' emotion, triumph, pathos, tragedy of the characters"

Galadriel captures this perfectly: "...together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat."

## Eucatastrophe

Tolkien coined this term for the sudden happy turn in stories that produces a joy bringing tears:

> "It perceives – if the story has literary 'truth' on the second plane – that this is indeed how things really do work in the Great World for which our nature is made."

> "I knew I had written a story of worth in 'The Hobbit' when reading it... I had suddenly in a fairly strong measure the 'eucatastrophic' emotion at Bilbo's exclamation: 'The Eagles! The Eagles are coming!'"

## On Journeys

> "For if there is anything in a journey of any length, for me it is this: a deliverance from the plantlike state of helpless passive sufferer, an exercise however small of will, and mobility – and of curiosity, without which a rational mind becomes stultified."

## Tom Bombadil: Two Interpretations

**As Pacifist**: "If you have, as it were taken 'a vow of poverty', renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself... then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you."

**As Scientist**: "An exemplar, a particular embodying of pure (real) natural science: the spirit that desires knowledge of other things, their history and nature, because they are 'other' and wholly independent of the enquiring mind... entirely unconcerned with 'doing' anything with the knowledge."

## On Work and Hobbies

> "I am a philologist, and all my work is philological. I avoid hobbies because I am a very serious person and cannot distinguish between private amusement and duty. I am affable, but unsociable. I only work for private amusement, since I find my duties privately amusing."

## Marriage and Relationships

On the different natures:
- Women are "instinctively, when uncorrupt, monogamous"
- "Men are not... Monogamy... is for us men a piece of 'revealed' ethic, according to faith and not to the flesh"
- "Faithfulness in Christian marriage entails that: great mortification"

Practical advice: "Get in straight and keep there with lover, fiancée, wife... A little fuss early saves a mort of trouble later."

## Why He Wrote

1. To process the First World War: "In my case it generated Morgoth and the History of the Gnomes"
2. Because nobody else wrote what he wanted to read: "Above all for heroic legend on the brink of fairy-tale and history, of which there is far too little in the world"
3. To give England its own epic: "I was from early days grieved by the poverty of my own beloved country: it had no stories of its own"
