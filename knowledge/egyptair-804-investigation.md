# EgyptAir Flight 804 Investigation

**Source**: Admiral Cloudberg article (Dec 2024) analyzing the finally-released investigation reports
**Crash Date**: May 19, 2016
**Aircraft**: Airbus A320 (66 fatalities)

## Summary

An A320 disappeared from radar over the Mediterranean en route Paris to Cairo. After 8+ years, Egypt released a 663-page final report containing both Egyptian (EAAID) and French (BEA) findings - reaching completely opposite conclusions.

**Egyptian conclusion**: Intentional explosive device in the galley
**French conclusion**: Accidental oxygen fire in the cockpit that could not be extinguished

## Why This Matters

- The BEA's methodical investigation vs Egypt's political-seeming conclusions demonstrates how accident investigations can go wrong
- Crew oxygen systems have caused multiple near-catastrophic fires on parked aircraft (never fatal until this case)
- Halon fire extinguishers are ineffective against oxygen-fed fires
- International aviation safety governance has limits when states don't cooperate

## Key Evidence Timeline

1. **00:25:24** - Hissing sound from FO's oxygen mask (valve was already improperly open)
2. **00:25:27** - "Pop" sound from inside mask stowage box
3. **00:25:29** - First officer shouts "Fire!" (2 seconds after the pop)
4. **00:26:10** - Lavatory smoke alarm
5. **00:26:56** - Avionics smoke alarm
6. **00:28:46** - Oxygen leak sound stops (cylinder exhausted)
7. **00:29:39** - Autopilot disconnects (multiple computer failures)
8. **00:29:48** - FDR stops
9. **00:29:57** - CVR stops
10. **00:38:50** - Last radar return (9 min spiral descent)

## BEA's Technical Findings

### Fire Origin
- First officer's oxygen mask stowage box
- Valve was already open (evidenced by mask mic being active for 30+ min before event)
- Probable ignition source: internal electrical failure/short circuit in oxygen tube
- Rapid propagation due to oxygen-enriched environment

### Why Extinguishing Failed
- Halon extinguishers don't cool the fire - they react with oxygen
- In oxygen-fed fires, fuel stays hot and reignites when oxygen continues flowing
- Tests showed fire reignited within 20 seconds even after halon discharge
- Only cutting oxygen supply FIRST gave meaningful delay

### Maintenance History Red Flags
- FO's oxygen box replaced 3 days before crash (press-to-test button "stuck")
- The replacement box was previously removed from another aircraft for faulty door reset mechanism
- Oxygen cylinder replaced 2 months prior due to unexplained quantity decreases
- Captain's box cover repaired the next day
- Spare mask reported inoperative earlier

## Egyptian Report Problems

Admiral Cloudberg identifies multiple failures in Egyptian methodology:

1. **TNT traces unreliable**: Found on remains recovered from seabed after 1+ month (should dissolve in 2 days per FAA)
2. **No explosion sound on CVR**: Every documented aircraft bombing captured the explosion
3. **No depressurization**: Cabin altitude warning never sounded during 4.5 min of CVR after alleged explosion
4. **No structural breakup**: Radar shows single target in controlled spiral, not debris
5. **Random TNT distribution**: Passengers who tested positive scattered throughout cabin, not near alleged bomb location
6. **Treated Triple Committee findings as unquestionable**: Bent evidence to fit predetermined conclusion

## Lessons for Investigation Methodology

- Chemical residue testing is NOT standard for proving aviation explosions
- Physical evidence (shatter zones, starburst patterns, penetration holes, curling patterns) is primary
- Wreckage reconstruction is essential for structural analysis
- CVR audio analysis can reveal system states (e.g., mic activity = valve position)
- Airflow studies needed to interpret smoke detector activation order

## Aviation Safety Implications

1. **Flow fuses**: Some aircraft have automatic shutoffs when oxygen leak detected; A320 didn't
2. **Procedures**: No existing procedure for identifying/fighting oxygen fires
3. **Halon replacement**: Already scheduled for 2025 phase-out
4. **Cockpit smoking**: Still captain's discretion in some jurisdictions despite risk
