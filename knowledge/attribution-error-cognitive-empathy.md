## The Core Concept

**Attribution error**: When explaining others' behavior, we overemphasize *disposition* (character, personality, essential nature) and underemphasize *situation* (circumstances they face).

Classic example: Someone cuts in line → "What a jerk" (disposition). But maybe they've never done this before and are about to miss a flight to see a dying relative (situation).

## The Nuanced Version: It's Situational

The original "fundamental" framing was too simple. Research revealed two key exceptions:

| Scenario | Attribution Bias |
|----------|------------------|
| **Enemy does something good** | Attribute to *situation* ("My rival gave to the homeless, but only to impress her") |
| **Ally does something bad** | Attribute to *situation* ("My friend embezzled, but his wife was sick") |

**Implication**: Attribution error itself is situational. We lean toward disposition for enemies, toward situation for allies.

## Why This Matters for Tribalism

This asymmetry reinforces tribal divisions:

- Your tribe does bad things → extraordinary circumstances (situation)
- Other tribe does good things → extraordinary circumstances (situation)
- **Conclusion**: Your tribe = essentially good; other tribe = essentially bad

This is why polarized politics are hard to de-polarize. Once categories are established, attribution error maintains them.

## International Politics Application

Herbert Kelman on enemy images:

> "Hostile actions by the enemy are attributed dispositionally, and thus provide further evidence of the enemy's inherently aggressive, implacable character. Conciliatory actions are explained away as reactions to situational forces—as tactical maneuvers, responses to external pressure, or temporary adjustments to a position of weakness—and therefore require no revision of the original image."

**Why arguments for invasion focus on evil leaders**: Once we believe a government is *essentially* bad, only regime change makes sense. If they change behavior for the better, we assume evil still lurks within.

## The Connection to Cognitive Empathy

**Cognitive empathy** (not emotional empathy): Seeing how things look from another person's point of view. Perspective taking.

Wright's thesis: Attribution error is the biggest impediment to cognitive empathy. If you're blind to how circumstance shapes someone's behavior, you can't appreciate how the world looks to them.

**Why this matters globally**: Many critical non-zero-sum problems (environment, arms control, disease, technology) require cooperation. Cooperation requires understanding the other side's perspective. Attribution error blocks that understanding.

## Lee Ross's Advice on Perspective Taking

When asked why he was so good at giving advice, Ross said:

> "Here's why, Dick: I don't take your point of view when you tell me what the problem is. I try to figure out how the other person or persons are viewing it."

Key insight: Ross wasn't at odds with the people whose perspective he was taking. His collaborator Nisbett was. That's why Ross could see their perspective more easily—he wasn't subject to the bias that kicks in when we're in conflict.

## Practical Takeaway

> When you're having trouble with someone you dislike, or at least someone you find highly annoying, and you're dying to tell someone about the problem, don't tell someone who shares your attitude toward them, even though that's the most tempting thing to do.

Tell someone who can take the other person's perspective without the tribal bias.

## The Clerics and Criminals Insight

Ross and Nisbett on how much "character" is actually situation:

> "Clerics and criminals rarely face an identical or equivalent set of situational challenges. Rather, they place themselves, and are placed by others, in situations that differ precisely in ways that induce clergy to look, act, feel, and think rather consistently like clergy and that induce criminals to look, act, feel, and think like criminals."

The point can be taken too far, but more commonly it's not taken far enough.

## The Challenge

Attribution error is a cognitive bias, likely engineered by natural selection to distort perception in self-serving ways. A well-engineered bias is stubborn—it fools people into thinking they're seeing clearly when they're not.

But awareness helps. Knowing that you systematically underweight situation when evaluating enemies and overweight it for allies creates an opening for correction.

## Key Quote

> "If I had to pick only one scientific finding about how the human mind works and promulgate it in hopes of saving the world, I'd probably go with attribution error."
