## Context

South Korea's martial law attempt (Dec 2024) failed quickly, demonstrating democratic resilience but also fragility. Countries that came late to liberal democracy, especially those shadowed by demographic decline and hostile neighbors, face particular challenges in the post-post-Cold War era.

The key question: if liberal democracy isn't simply overthrown, what hybrid regimes might emerge?

## Three Emerging Regime Types

### 1. Fortress Nationalism

**Goal**: Preserve national identity, culture, ethnic/linguistic/religious distinctives by limiting immigration and deploying state power for culturally conservative ends.

**Examples**:
- Hungary (Orbán) - prototype
- Italy (Meloni)
- Poland (Law and Justice Party)
- Israel (rightward shift)

**Characteristics**:
- Rejects open borders and multiculturalism
- Skeptical of noncitizen rights
- May evolve toward "managed democracy" (free elections but tilted playing field, single dominant party) - similar to 20th century Japan, Mexico

**The Defenders' Argument**:
- This is just restoring pre-1989 norms of sovereignty (de Gaulle, not Pétain)
- Closed borders actually *preserve* domestic liberty by preventing ethno-religious tensions that undermine social cohesion

**Variation - Fortress Liberalism**:
- Northern European variant (Denmark as test case)
- Closed borders + enforced assimilation to protect feminism, free speech, social liberalism from fundamentalism
- Immigration restriction *in service of* liberal values

### 2. Managerial Multiculturalism

**Goal**: Preserve post-1989 liberal vision through expanded technocratic power - policing speech, regulating debate, limiting acceptable opinion.

**Examples**:
- Britain - arresting people for social media posts to suppress ethnic tensions
- Canada (Trudeau) - "de-banking" protesters, suppressing populist movements (2022)
- Germany - contemplating outright ban on AfD party

**Characteristics**:
- Appeals to progressive elites
- Believes utopian ambitions achievable with "a little extra power" for technocrats
- Tools: disinformation policing, hate speech prosecution, removing candidates from ballots
- Most influential in non-American Anglosphere

**Potential Evolution**:
- May reach limits (Trudeau, Starmer moving rightward on immigration)
- Period of managerial multiculturalism might make fortress liberalism more appealing
- Could spread to East Asia (Japan, Korea, Taiwan) as immigration increases to address population collapse

### 3. Wide-Open Republicanism (America's Path)

**Why America won't adopt the other models**:
- Too diverse and porous for sustained fortress governance
- Too sprawling and fragmented for effective disinformation/wrongthink policing
- Exception: unique moments like early Covid pandemic

**What It Means**:
- Freer than Britain, more open than Hungary
- Lacks consensus-enforcement mechanisms of the recent past
- Wild policy swings with coalition changes
- Persistent circulation of strange ideas: "radical, dangerous, toxic, intriguing"
- More cranks in cabinet posts
- More ideological obsessions and odd religious ideas in intelligentsia
- Peace through distance (Oregon vs. Alabama) and balance-of-power settlements, not shared establishment consensus

**The Paradox**:
- Feels like maxing-out liberalism in some ways, retreat in others
- Greater dynamism than fortress/managerial alternatives
- Countries that stay similarly open (France over Britain/Germany; India among non-Western powers) more likely to keep up with US
- More carefully managed societies likely to fall behind

**The Risk**:
- Dangerous, destabilizing, anxiety-inducing
- Existential stakes shadowing every election and cultural debate
- Authoritarian future possible as reaction to these anxieties
- Fear that society is "walking a high wire, teetering over an abyss of fractious radicalisms"

## Key Insight

The American future looks more *open* even as peers and allies become more *closed* in different ways:
- Open to varieties of both liberalism and post-liberalism
- Open to whatever world is coming next

This openness is both strength (dynamism) and vulnerability (instability).

| Fortress Liberalism | Closed | Free (from fundamentalism) | Liberal | Northern Europe progressives |
| Managerial Multiculturalism | Open | Policed | Liberal but constrained | Technocratic elites |
| Wide-Open Republicanism | Contested | Chaotic | Full but polarized | ? |
