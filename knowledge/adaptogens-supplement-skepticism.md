# Adaptogens and Supplement Marketing Skepticism

Source: Science-Based Medicine (2024)

## What Are "Adaptogens"?

Marketing claim: Natural products that help the body "adapt to stress" by interacting with the HPA axis, boosting immunity, reducing oxidative stress, or "balancing hormones."

Reality: The term was coined in 1947 by Soviet toxicologist Nikolai Lazarev but has never been scientifically validated or recognized by the FDA as a legitimate claim.

## Key Skepticism Points

**Vague terminology is a feature, not a bug:**
- Allows general marketing vibes without specific falsifiable claims
- Same pattern as: "boosting immune system," "reducing toxins," "harmonizing energy"
- Researchers note the term "undermines the need for increased inquiry" by being imprecise

**Regulatory arbitrage via DSHEA:**
- US Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act created "structure-function" claims
- Supplements can claim to "support" or "boost" without proving anything
- No FDA approval required for these vague wellness claims

**Historical pattern:**
- Same products (echinacea, etc.) have been sold for 100+ years
- Marketing language evolves: "native remedies" → "all natural" → "nutraceuticals" → "adaptogens"
- The rebranding is the innovation, not the product

## Red Flags in Supplement Marketing

1. Claims stated as "beliefs" rather than evidence ("experts believe...")
2. Sciencey-sounding but vague terms (ergogenic, adaptogenic, nutraceutical)
3. Multiple simultaneous claimed mechanisms (immune + hormones + stress + energy)
4. Appeals to "ancient wisdom" + "modern science"
5. No specific dosing or bioavailability information

## Useful Heuristic

If an herb had a useful pharmacological effect, it would likely already be purified and sold as a pharmaceutical. The supplement industry rarely markets products as "naturally-occurring drugs with variable constituents of unknown dose" because that's accurate but not appealing.
