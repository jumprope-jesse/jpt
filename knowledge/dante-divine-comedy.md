## Why It Endures

Despite being 14,000+ lines of intricately rhymed medieval Italian poetry full of obscure biblical, classical, and political references, the Comedy has been translated into English more frequently than any other work of literature. New translations, studies, and lectures appear constantly.

**What makes it work:**
- Strikingly original, fascinating story that keeps you turning pages
- Endlessly inventive scenes with psychologically complex characters
- Narrator displays broad emotional range: tender pity to bitter anger to savage satisfaction
- Amazingly flexible style: straightforward narrative to intricate description, sublime to vulgar, rhetorical flourishes to heartrending dialogue
- Detailed view of 13th-century politics, social customs, problems
- Extended philosophical/theological discussions on central human questions: what we are, how we live, how we should live
- Creates a unified imaginative universe of astonishing richness

"It is in some ways an ancestor of The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and other such worlds in which so many young people immerse themselves today."

## Structure & Form

**Terza rima** ("third rhyme") - form created by Dante for this work:
- Three-line units (tercets)
- First and third lines rhyme with each other
- Second line rhymes with first and third of the following tercet
- Creates components that are simultaneously independent and interlocking

**Meter**: Hendecasyllabics (11-syllable lines) - corresponds to English iambic pentameter

**The title**: Dante called it simply *Commedia* (Comedy). "Divine" was added by 16th-century editors. "Comedy" here means:
1. Written in the low/common style (Tuscan dialect, not Latin)
2. Protagonist in difficulty at outset but tending toward happy ending (salvation available to all who truly desire it)

## Historical Context

**Setting**: April 1300, when Dante was nearing 35 - "midway through" the biblical threescore-and-ten lifespan

**Not the Dark Ages**: Dante's medieval world featured great learning and sophistication, subtlety and refinement, reverence for cultural heritage. More geographical/scientific awareness than commonly assumed.

**But remarkably violent**: High proportion of monarchs in the Comedy who were murdered. Constant warfare between and within city-states.

**Italian political structure**: Central/northern Italy organized as independent city-states (republics or ruled by princes). Small enough for prominent citizens to know each other personally.

**The Guelph-Ghibelline conflict**:
- Guelphs: Supported papal temporal power
- Ghibellines: Supported Holy Roman Empire as legitimate secular authority
- Originated 1075 when Pope Gregory VII asserted papal authority over secular matters
- In Florence: flared into open conflict 1215 after a broken engagement led to murder
- By 1290s: Guelphs split into Blacks (Donati family) and Whites (evolved toward Ghibellinism)

**Dante's position**: Allied with Whites - believed empire was divine instrument of temporal authority, fiercely opposed church's pursuit of secular power

## Dante's Life

**Born**: Florence, 1265, under sign of Gemini (mid-May to mid-June)
**Family**: Modest finances but notable lineage; great-great-grandfather was a crusader
**Marriage**: Betrothed at 12 to Gemma di Manetto Donati; married ~1285; three sons and a daughter (who became a nun named Beatrice)

**Beatrice**: According to *Vita nuova*, the most important relationship began at age 9 when he first saw 8-year-old Beatrice Portinari. She married a banker, had children, died 1290 at 24. The *Vita nuova* describes intense love sustained on slightest contacts, gradually deepening as he confronted his own defects, culminating in resolve after her death to write of her worthily.

**Political career**:
- 1289: Cavalryman at Battle of Campaldino
- 1295: Joined Apothecaries' Guild (required for politics; open to poets/scholars)
- June 1300: Selected as prior (one of six governing council members)
- Spoke against Pope Boniface VIII's requests for military support

**Exile**:
- October 1301: Part of delegation to Rome; detained by Boniface
- November 1: Charles of Valois led army into Florence; Dante's enemies took control
- January 27, 1302: Convicted in absentia on trumped-up charges, stripped of property, banished
- Later intensified to death sentence if found in city
- Never saw Florence again

**Exile years**: Wandered through northern Italy - Lucca, Padua, Bologna; extended stay in Verona (1312-1318); finally settled in Ravenna
**Death**: September 13, 1321, probably malarial fever

**Writing the Comedy**:
- Began *Inferno* ~1308, completed by 1314
- *Purgatorio* circulating by 1318
- *Paradiso* completed months before death

## The Revenge Dimension

"Dante is taking revenge, with the limited means available to him, on those who have destroyed his life... seeking relief from the pains, both physical and psychological, of his situation."

Pope Boniface VIII (died 1303) comes in for particular abuse. Though still alive in April 1300 when the poem takes place, Canto XIX of *Inferno* shows the precise spot in Hell waiting for him.

But deeper than revenge: "He is holding out for adherence to the highest possible standards, no matter what the cost, in a world in which hypocrisy, expediency, and self-serving seem to be the surest roads to success."

## Reading Notes

The claim that Dante "populated Hell almost exclusively with thirteenth-century Florentines" is a canard - while most souls he *interacts with* are Florentines (they share his language), innumerable thousands of others are visible everywhere.

An unannotated Divine Comedy is "almost unimaginable" - unlike the Iliad, Odyssey, or Aeneid, which can be largely understood without annotations.
