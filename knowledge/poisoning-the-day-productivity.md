# Poisoning the Day - Fatalist Productivity Philosophy

*Source: https://ashore.io/journal/crossover-creativity/poisoning-the-day - Added: 2026-01-18*

A fatalistic approach to productivity from Jack Antonoff (musician/producer): accept that focus cannot be sustained indefinitely - at some point each day, something will take you out.

## Core Concept

> "Every day is a new beginning. You wake up and at some point in the day, someone shoots up a school, or something's going on with your family, or you wake up and eat the wrong thing. And then you're done. Emotionally cooked. Literally and emotionally poisoned."

The "poison" can be:
- News about the state of the world
- Family/personal issues surfacing
- Your own emotions
- Physical factors (eating wrong, poor sleep)
- Any notification/message that derails mental state

## The Strategy

**Before the poison:**
- Get high-IQ, mentally challenging work done early
- Limit exposure to outside stimuli (digital minimalism, no phone)
- Run the gauntlet until something inevitably strikes

**After the poison:**
- Don't fight it - the magic is gone, you're not getting it back
- Reschedule demanding tasks to the next day
- Shift to easy tasks: food, calling friends/family, watching TV
- Accept the horse has bolted

## Jeff Bezos Version

> "I like to do my high IQ meetings before lunch, like anything mentally challenging, that's a 10am meeting. By like 5pm I can't think about anything."

## Night Owl Alternative

Flip the approach: avoid the day entirely, then work when it's over.

Example: Demis Hassabis works a "second day" from 11pm to 4am.

## The Kill Zone

The post-lunch afternoon is dangerous:
- Everyone's about
- Tweets are flying
- News keeps happening
- Maximum exposure to day-poisoning events

> "It's the reason I sincerely doubt that anything great in the history of humanity has been built in the post-lunch afternoon."

## Why This Resonates

- Fatalistic acceptance vs. fighting for focus
- Removes guilt about "losing" a day
- Provides permission to stop when derailed
- Explains why early morning routines are popular (minimize poison exposure)
- Parents already operate this way - kids are "professional day poisoners"

## Practical Application

1. Schedule demanding/creative work for first thing (whatever "first thing" means for your chronotype)
2. Minimize notification exposure during protected time
3. When derailed, don't waste energy trying to recover - pivot to low-stakes tasks
4. Build systems assuming daily derailment is inevitable
