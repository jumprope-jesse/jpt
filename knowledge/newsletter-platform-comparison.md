## Platform Lock-in Concerns (Substack)

From John Gruber's analysis (Nov 2024):

- Substack has pulled a "devious trick" making people call publications "Substacks" - similar to calling a WordPress blog "a WordPress"
- All Substack publications look the same (distinctive Spectral serif font, loose kerning)
- Home pages default to email signup with tiny "No thanks" link to actually read content
- Social features (Notes) are a transparent lock-in play - tying your audience interaction to their platform
- Substack tries to have it both ways: claiming publications are "independent" while presenting them all as parts of Substack

## Alternatives to Substack

| Platform | Used By | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Ghost** | Casey Newton (Platformer), Molly White (Citation Needed) | Self-hostable, distinctive branding |
| **Beehiiv** | Craig Calcaterra (Cup of Coffee), Oliver Darcy (Status) | Better subscription management |
| **Passport** | Ben Thompson (Stratechery) | Custom platform, Stratechery predates Substack |

## Key Considerations for Writers

1. **Branding**: Alternatives allow distinctive look and feel
2. **Subscription management**: Ghost and Beehiiv offer better interfaces
3. **Independence**: Your publication shouldn't look like "a section of Substack"
4. **Audience ownership**: Avoid platforms that tie your social graph to their ecosystem
