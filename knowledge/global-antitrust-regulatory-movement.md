# Global Antitrust Regulatory Movement (2020s)

## Overview

A growing international movement among regulators to check corporate power, particularly of tech giants, using antitrust enforcement and broader policy tools. The movement has shifted from Europe-led to increasingly US-driven action.

## Brussels Conference on Antitrust

The annual Brussels Conference on Antitrust at the Steigenberger Wiltcher's hotel has become a key gathering point for global regulators - described as an "anti-Davos." The 2024 event drew ~1,000 attendees including corporate lawyers, lobbyists, regulators, journalists, and students.

### Key Attendees (2024)
- **Lina Khan** - FTC Chair
- **Jonathan Kanter** - DOJ Antitrust Division
- **Katherine Tai** - US Trade Representative
- **Olivier Guersent** - Senior EU antitrust official (representing Margrethe Vestager)
- **Rebecca Kelly Slaughter** - FTC Commissioner

## Rhetorical Shift: Beyond Economics

Modern antitrust regulators frame their work as protecting **political freedom**, not just economic competition. This represents a significant departure from purely technocratic approaches.

Katherine Tai argued for "breaking out of some of these colonial and post-colonial structures" and "transitioning out of old systems and trying to create new ones that are democratic and competitive." She received applause - rare at such events.

## US vs EU Approach

### Current Dynamics (2024)

**US Position:**
- "Fluent and assertive with language about democracy and liberty"
- More direct and aggressive enforcement posture
- Talking to people across the country
- "Pushing themselves to the limit of what the law allows them to do"
- Making headlines with cases against Amazon, Google, and likely Apple

**EU Position:**
- "Still talking the language of protecting the competitive process"
- More technocratic framing
- Limited by upcoming EU parliamentary elections
- Digital Markets Act (effective March 2024) provides new preemptive tools
- Resource constraints: "Certainly not with 40 people" - Guersent on DMA enforcement capacity

### Power Shift Timeline

The momentum has shifted:
1. **Europe** (2010s) - Aggressive pursuit of Google and others
2. **Britain** - Meta acquisition unwinding
3. **United States** (2020s) - Biden appointees embrace muscular corporate restraint

## Internal EU Tensions

Olivier Guersent sparked controversy by stating competition enforcement was merely a "side dish" to other policy areas and "none of this has to do with competition." This prompted rebuttals throughout the conference.

FTC Commissioner Slaughter responded: "Competition underlies and is implicated by all the work of government. And we're either going to do that with open eyes thinking about the competition... or we're going to do that with our eyes closed."

Financial Times columnist Rana Foroohar criticized Europeans as "still stuck in the narrow, technocratic" views while Americans are passing them by. Guersent responded angrily with a letter defending EU's enforcement record.

## Major Active Cases

- **Meta/Instagram/WhatsApp** - FTC sued in 2020 to force divestiture, still no trial date as of 2024
- **Amazon** - Fall 2023 lawsuit, trial scheduled for 2026
- **Apple** - Expected DOJ case, likely not fully resolved until 2030s
- **Google** - Multi-decade EU pursuit continues

## Policy Tools Beyond Antitrust

Regulators advocate for diverse approaches including:
- Trade policy
- Industrial policy
- Tax policy
- Data governance (Tai withdrew US proposals on data flow, local storage, source code transfer)

## Structural Challenges

### Speed Mismatch
"Antitrust is glacial" - companies move fast, government slowly. Cases can take 5-10+ years to resolve.

### Scale Mismatch
A $1 trillion tech giant operates at a scale that even large agencies can't match in resources or speed.

### "Too Little, Too Late" Concern
Progressive antitrust thinkers worry that monopoly power of tech giants needed to be addressed 15 years ago. Current enforcement may be insufficient to reverse entrenched dominance.

## Business World Response

**Wall Street Uncertainty:** Investors lack clarity on what bets are safe and whether pushback will continue in potential Republican administration.

**Chinese Ownership Issue:** The Brussels conference hotel's Chinese ownership forced some US officials to stay elsewhere.

## US Trade Policy Shift

Katherine Tai announced withdrawal of long-standing digital trade proposals in October 2023:
- Promoting free flow of data across borders
- Prohibiting local data storage requirements
- Prohibiting source code transfer requirements

This represents a significant shift from both Democratic and Republican administrations' previous positions, aimed at curbing power of Google, Meta, Amazon and other tech giants.

## Key Figures

**Cristina Caffarra** - Competition economist, conference organizer. Sees European technocratic language as "entirely inadequate to the task."

**Tommaso Valletti** - Former head antitrust economist at European Commission, now at Imperial College London. Notes US posture is "much more direct and aggressive."

**Andreas Schwab** - German MEP who introduced 2014 nonbinding resolution to break up Google. Supports interventionist measures but notes EU treaty limitations.

## Implications for Software Engineers & Founders

- Regulatory changes may impact how software is developed and marketed
- International regulations can affect even small companies
- Focus on democracy and corporate responsibility reflects societal shift
- Potential opportunity to incorporate these values into company culture and branding
- Balance needed between compliance creativity and regulatory requirements
- Aggressive regulation could stifle innovation (counterargument)
- Corporate restraint push may create inefficiencies (counterargument)
