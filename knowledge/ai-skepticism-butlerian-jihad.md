# AI Skepticism: The Butlerian Jihad Movement

Cultural and philosophical opposition to AI that mimics human cognition, framed through Frank Herbert's Dune concept: "Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind."

## The "Hard No" Movement

A growing cultural stance against engagement with LLMs/AI, distinct from traditional Luddism:

**Key characteristics:**
- Deep-seated, almost spiritual aversion to AI simulacra
- Holds even when specific objections are addressed or nitpicked
- Sense that something is "grotesque about these simulacra, the people who push them on us"
- Treated as betrayal of creative class solidarity

**Cultural manifestations (as of 2025):**
- Anti-AI clauses becoming standard in book contracts and magazine submissions
- The Chicago pope criticized AI in his first major speech
- ComicCon crowd chanting "fuck AI" (The Studio, AppleTV)
- T-shirt culture, internet traps poisoning AI datasets

**The literary world sentiment:**
> Writers, artists, and others increasingly view any amount of engagement with LLMs as a betrayal of creative class solidarity.

## AI and Academic Cheating

The "killer app" for ChatGPT in America: cheating on homework.

### Scale of the Problem

From a composition teacher's firsthand experience:
- First semester: caught 1 tech-minded student
- Second semester: caught a couple more
- Third semester (fall 2024): 25% of class submitted AI-written rhetorical analysis papers

**Types of students using AI:**
- Initially: comp-sci, business majors, generally disengaged
- Now: includes highly engaged students, creative writing majors, even those analyzing essays *about* AI

### Common "User Errors" That Expose Cheating

1. Forgetting to include byline when pasting text → AI fills in wrong author
2. Submitting event reports before the event occurred
3. Reflections referencing projects the class didn't do
4. Gushing about mentorship from a professor never visited at office hours

### The Detection Arms Race

- Students increasingly deny cheating when confronted, knowing escalation is burdensome
- Harder to establish probable cause without obvious errors
- Some students use prompts to insert typos, make text seem authentic
- Even with licit disclosure options (cited AI use), zero students choose to disclose

### Why This Matters

**The learning bypass:**
- Big difference between getting something explained vs. actual learning
- AI severs connection between output and the practice/thinking that creates it
- Students skip "desirable difficulties" that produce real learning
- Even students who understand this use AI for GPA/time/stress reasons

**The forklift metaphor:**
> Having AI compose your work is like using a forklift at the gym.

**The societal concern:**
> I don't want to live in a society where people can't compose a coherent sentence without a bot in the mix.

## Counter-Strategies for Educators

### What Doesn't Work

**Google Docs monitoring:**
- Required students to compose in docs to track copy-pasting
- Too much friction, students can still type from ChatGPT in another window
- Constant access issues, Canvas integration problems

**Syllabus options tried:**
1. **Cited Use** - Students cite AI like any source → Zero students ever cited AI
2. **Guided Use** - AI as directed by instructor → Requires constant policing
3. **Unauthorized Use** - Acknowledgment that AI "could help" but please don't → Students use it anyway

### What Might Work (Proposed)

**Pen and paper:**
- Devices put away entirely
- Handwritten freewrites, notes, marked-up printed readings
- Line notes in colored ink
- Old-school methodology that "successfully educated generations"

**Process over product:**
- Grades more for completion and participation than output quality
- Focus on the writing/thinking process, not final deliverables
- Removes incentive to optimize the artifact

**Accept adversarial reality:**
- Grading now feels "more adversarial and less collaborative"
- Banish cop-mindset while still recognizing the disservice of letting students bypass learning

## The Cognitive/Mental Health Angle

### AI and Mental Distress

From Rolling Stone reporting: "ChatGPT-induced psychosis" - users falling into existential confusion from extended chatbot conversations.

### Students' Own Perspectives

Many students express deep frustration about tech stack they never chose:
- Phones, screens, social media, Zoom, online educational platforms
- AI as another layer on addictive stack
- Addictive patterns often get worse at college without family structure
- Some students' "Writing to Future" projects imagined AI-free futures

### The Permission Problem

> Many of them deeply resent that they never had a choice about all this.

## Policy Implications

Author argues for restricting AI access for young people similar to restrictions on:
- Smoking
- Alcohol
- Gambling
- Sex

**Developmental rationale:**
- Behaviors that disproportionately harm young people
- Young people don't yet have capacity to self-regulate
- Policies are imperfect but do steer behavior

**Safety rationale:**
- AI companies cannot create LLM "personalities" that won't generate CSAM
- Systems regularly engage minors in sexual roleplay
- Celebrity voices used inappropriately

## The Broader Pattern

### Cheating Beyond Homework

AI cheating extends beyond education:
- Business decisions based on nonexistent citations
- Legal work with hallucinated caselaw
- Scientific work with fabricated sources

**The slope:**
> Choosing convenience over fidelity to the truth - perhaps the slipperiest slope of all.

### A Framework for Response

The author proposes thinking about AI's negative cognitive impacts like addiction regulation:

> "We might be in a place in 20-30 years where AI is like the laudanum/heroin of the late 19th century; everybody loved it, was instantly addicted, and it was so bad we had to invent new kinds of crime and regulation."

---

## The Optimistic Spin

Despite the challenges, the author is hopeful:

> "Beating the likeness bots and the cheating machines will require us to become more present with each other, more humble and careful in our words and choices, and, most of all, more human."

The struggle against AI may force positive changes:
- More presence and human connection
- More care in communication
- Revival of analog methods that foster focus
- A respite from dark patterns

## Key Quotes

On the nature of anti-AI sentiment:
> "Many people sense that there is something grotesque about these simulacra, the people who push them on us, this whole affair."

On grading bot-written work:
> "Engaging earnestly with bot-written text is mentally deadening... There's just no there there."

On the Dune metaphor:
> "The Dune books are all about how holy wars and revolutions are not gentle or reasonable, how they can turn ugly, righteousness fueling a fire that can consume nations and worlds."
