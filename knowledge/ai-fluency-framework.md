# AI Fluency Framework

## Overview

The AI Fluency Framework is a structured approach to human-AI collaboration developed by professors Rick Dakan (Ringling College of Art and Design) and Joseph Feller (University College Cork) in partnership with Anthropic.

## The 4D Framework

Four interconnected competencies for effective, efficient, ethical, and safe human-AI collaboration:

### 1. Delegation
Deciding what tasks to hand off to AI vs. keep for yourself. Understanding where AI excels and where human judgment is essential.

### 2. Description
Crafting effective prompts and instructions. The art of communicating what you want to the AI clearly and completely.

### 3. Discernment
Evaluating AI outputs critically. Recognizing quality, accuracy, and when to accept vs. iterate on results.

### 4. Diligence
Iterating through the description-discernment loop. Systematic refinement and responsible use over time.

## Key Principles

- **Framework-based, not prompt-based**: Focuses on building competencies rather than collecting "cool prompts"
- **Model-agnostic**: Applies regardless of which AI models or tools emerge
- **Multidisciplinary**: Spans technical, creative, business, scientific, and educational domains
- **Responsible engagement**: Emphasizes safe and ethical AI use alongside effectiveness

## The Description-Discernment Loop

The practical application cycle:
1. **Describe** - Craft a prompt/instruction
2. **Submit** - Get AI output
3. **Discern** - Evaluate the result critically
4. **Iterate** - Refine and repeat as needed

## Course Structure

**Part 1: Foundations**
- Foundational understanding of generative AI systems
- Why AI fluency matters
- Core capabilities and limitations of current AI
- Conceptual grounding for strategic (not reactive) AI use

**Part 2: Practical Application**
- Hands-on competencies across the 4D areas
- Systematic approaches to project planning with AI
- Practical prompting techniques
- Application across creative, business, and educational contexts

## Three Ways to Interact with AI

The course introduces three interaction paradigms (details in the full course).

## Collaboration Model

The course itself demonstrates the framework principles:
- Content developed through extensive Claude 3.7 collaboration
- Human authors provided vision, expertise, critical judgment, domain knowledge
- AI assisted with structural development, content drafting, editing
- All final decisions made by human authors
- Transparent disclosure of AI's role in development

## Why This Matters

- Moves beyond "tips and tricks" to building durable collaboration skills
- Applicable as AI tools evolve and change
- Balances effectiveness with responsibility
- Provides vocabulary and mental models for discussing AI collaboration
