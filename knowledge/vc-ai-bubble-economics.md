### Current State (Q1 2025)

**The short version:**
- Venture capital is moribund except AI
- AI is moribund except OpenAI
- OpenAI is a "weird scam that wants to burn money so fast it summons AI God"
- Nobody can cash out

**Key stat:** 57.9% of global VC dollars in Q1 went to AI/ML startups - mostly driven by OpenAI.

### The Zero Interest Rate Hangover

**2008-2022 dynamics:**
- Financial crisis → central banks dropped rates near zero
- Low interest meant pension funds, etc. needed alternative returns
- Flood of money into venture capital
- Funded "ridiculous startups" - businesses losing money on every transaction
- SoftBank exemplified this (WeWork disaster)
- Borrowing was almost free, so companies loaded up on debt

**Post-2022 reality:**
- Inflation forced rates back up
- Treasury bills now yield 5% - why take VC risk?
- VCs seem to have "completely forgot how to do anything without free money"

### Structural Problems

**Exit market frozen:**
- Trump tariffs killed IPO market confidence
- IPOs aren't "popping" on launch
- CoreWeave IPO fell flat despite AI buzz (40% of all Q1 exits by value alone)
- Wiz Security/Google acquisition was the other major exit
- "The rest of the exit market has remained relatively silent"

**First-time financing collapsed:**
- $3.8B across 892 deals in Q1 (down QoQ and YoY)
- "Only $10 billion was raised across 87 VC funds, setting a pace for the lowest year of fundraising in a decade"
- Charles River Ventures returned $275 million of uncommitted capital to investors

**Zombie startups:**
- Funding rounds increasingly late-stage (life support for existing companies)
- Secondary sales let employees cash out some equity so talent doesn't quit
- VCs protecting imaginary valuations on their books
- "A pile of startups just ran out of cash and died in 2024 - more than in 2023. And 2025 is expected to be even worse."

### The AI-Only Hope

**FOMO dynamics:**
- AI is the only prospect for a lottery-level win
- Crypto's dead, quantum isn't taking off
- a16z raising $20 billion fund to keep the AI bubble going
- VCs believe "marketing brochure version" of AI because they "don't actually know anything about technology"

**The Pitchbook self-deception:**
> "Just as 'internet' evolved from buzzword to business backbone, AI is following the same playbook."

Counter: "A completely different thing taking off and working says nothing about whether your personal favourite thing will take off and work"

### The Industry's "Plan"

**From the report:** Hope really hard. Maybe markets recover. Maybe IPOs pop again. Maybe Trump gets coherent.

> "These guys haven't got a clue what to do next. They really don't. This is the industry talking to itself and saying 'well gosh, chaps, looks like we're screwed.'"

### Political Context

Silicon Valley VC/executive crowd worked hard to elect Trump, sat in front row at inauguration - then surprised when tariffs hurt their business.

> "The Trump economic disaster is the most important material fact for the venture capital sphere."

---

## Key Insight: Lucky ≠ Smart

> "It's important to note something else here: quite a lot of the venture capital class are not actually so bright. But they got lucky once."

Evidence of poor judgment:
- Joined billionaire group chat with "literal neo-Nazis as their court philosophers" (Semafor)
- Marc Andreessen got into e/acc - "literally a neo-Fascist revival movement"
- Their entire future plan is hoping Trump stops "acting like a bizarre freak"

> "These are not people who can be trusted with dangerous machinery such as billions of dollars. They were lucky as hell, and now they're not."

## The Two Models: Benchmark vs a16z (Historical Context)

*Source: NYT, December 2024*
*https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/technology/andreessen-horowitz-benchmark-venture-capital.html*

### The Boutique Model: Benchmark (1995)

**Philosophy:** "Small is beautiful" - quoted Voltaire: "God is not on the side of the big arsenals, but on the side of those who shoot best."

**Structure:**
- 5 partners, equal decision-making power, equal profit split
- No army of analysts, associates, junior partners
- $425M funds (same size since 2004)
- Website is a single landing page

**Track record:** First 8 funds (1995-2019) returned 7.5x after fees. Early wins: eBay ($6.7M → $4B), Uber, Twitter, Yelp, Zillow.

**Philosophy in action (Cerebras deal, 2016):** Founder chose Benchmark's small fund because "You make money when we make money" - investors not getting rich on management fees.

### The Mega-Fund Model: Andreessen Horowitz (2009)

**Origin story:** Founded by Marc Andreessen (Netscape) and Ben Horowitz as the "anti-Benchmark" - treating founders better with services (PR, sales, recruiting teams).

**Current scale:**
- $44B under management
- 80 investment partners, 5 offices
- Registered investment adviser (can own public stocks, crypto)
- 8 newsletters, 7 podcasts, 800+ portfolio companies
- Private wealth management services
- Persistent IPO rumors

**Key expansion:** 2019 SEC registration to invest beyond private startups - promoted "massive ambition" to become best investor in everything. 19+ firms followed (Sequoia, General Catalyst, Thrive).

### The Fee Economics

Traditional VC: 2% annual fee + 20% of profits.

**Problem with mega-funds:** Cambridge Associates data shows:
- Smaller funds: higher returns but higher loss rates
- Bigger funds: median returns, fewer losses (safer but less upside)
- "You don't invest in V.C. to get median returns"

By 2020: 16 firms had $1B+ funds (up from 3 five years prior).

### The "Crybabies" Moment

When Sarah Lacy told Andreessen his firm had "forever eroded the comfortable margins of venture capital":

> "Aw, that is so sad. I feel terrible! How will they afford their third vineyard?"

Horowitz separately called competitors who didn't want to compete "the crybabies of Silicon Valley."

### Internal Debate at Benchmark

**2020:** New partner Miles Grimshaw (from Thrive) joined, prompting internal debate about expanding.

Arguments for expansion: Bigger deals, more companies, compete with mega-funds.

Arguments against: Managing staff distracts from finding/helping startups. Worse returns.

**Result:** Stayed small. Grimshaw returned to Thrive in 2024, which then raised $5B fund.

### AI Investments: The Gap

- **a16z:** ~86 AI companies including OpenAI
- **Benchmark:** ~20 AI companies (5 partners doing 1-2 deals/year each)

**11x.ai case study (2024):**
1. Benchmark's Sarah Tavel won deal to lead $24M round
2. Before announcement, a16z swooped in with $50M, 4x'ing valuation in months

### Industry Return Crisis (2022-2023)

For first time in a decade, VC invested more than it returned to LPs. Made it harder for smaller firms to raise; mega-funds stayed flush (a16z raised $7.2B in April 2024).

## Porter's Five Forces Analysis: Why LLM Makers Are Bad Businesses

*Source: Cal Patterson, November 2024*
*https://calpaterson.com/porter.html*

### The Framework

What makes a business profitable isn't efficiency, hard work, or innovation—it's **industry structure**. Michael Porter's Five Forces:

1. Power of suppliers to increase prices
2. Power of buyers to reduce prices
3. Strength of direct competitors
4. Threat of new entrants
5. Threat of substitutes

**Airlines (terrible business):** Locked into one of two plane makers (supplier power), price-sensitive customers switch for pennies (buyer power), easy to start new airlines (new entrants), trains and Zoom exist (substitutes).

**Coca-Cola (great business):** Cheap commoditized inputs (no supplier power), consumers weirdly loyal to brand despite identical taste (no buyer power), trademarks block new entrants, no real substitutes.

### LLM Makers: Airlines, Not Coca-Cola

| Force | Assessment | Details |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Supplier power** | Catastrophic | NVIDIA is the only real supplier. All models train on their chips regardless of cloud vendor. More power than Airbus/Boeing combined. |
| **Buyer power** | High | Users switch ChatGPT↔Claude easily. Companies use abstraction layers specifically to avoid lock-in. No brand loyalty forming. |
| **Competitors** | Strong | Many vendors, competitive pricing. Meta dumps Llama for free (Internet Explorer playbook). |
| **New entrants** | Easy | Techniques openly published. Even bad cheap models can gain footholds. |
| **Substitutes** | Mixed | Humans still better for non-hallucinating work. Metadata tends to displace AI once applications mature. |

### The Netscape Parallel

> "LLM makers look a lot more like Netscape—who invented graphical web browsers, then went bust—than Google, who made something good that ran on top of the web browsers."

Technology success ≠ business success:
- Docker: Great tech, made nothing
- Web browsers: Extremely advanced, not considered a business
- Salesforce: Terrible CRM product, tremendous business success

### Why the Massive Funding Anyway?

OpenAI's $6.6B round ($157B valuation) options:
1. **Build own chips?** Not enough for a fab, and NVIDIA invested in the round
2. **Build brand lock-in?** Difficult with text-in/text-out API
3. **Raise barrier to entry?** $6.6B isn't that much capital; won't dissuade others

**WeWork cautionary tale:** Raised $10B at $47B valuation, now worth $0.56B.

### The Cynical Take on AI Safety

> "The AI safety movement is a fantastic hypeman for LLMs as a technology. Implying (pretty dubiously) that we are 10 minutes from midnight in some kind of Ghost-in-The-Shell style AI crisis is in fact an extremely effective form of product marketing."

### Strategic Implication

> "Ideally, if I were running an AI business I would avoid building a model at all costs. Building your own models looks like an undifferentiated schlep."

Better play: Use cheap API calls to someone else's expensively-trained model.

## Business Disillusionment: AI Doesn't Deliver

### The Reliability Problem

Businesses are finding that generative AI just can't be depended on for customer-facing applications.

**Gary Marcus (cognitive scientist):**
> "Almost everybody seemed to come back with a report like, 'This is super cool, but I can't actually get it to work reliably enough to roll out to our customers.'"

### Notable Customer Service Failures

| Company | What Happened |
|---------|---------------|
| UK company | Chatbot began swearing at customers and trash-talking its employers |
| California car dealership | ChatGPT-powered salesman started offering buyers $1 cars |
| Air Canada | Chatbot lied to grieving customer about bereavement discount; airline forced to pay damages |

### The Core Technical Problem

**Rumman Chowdhury (Humane Intelligence CEO):**
> "No one wants to build a product on a model that makes things up. The core problem is that GenAI models are not information retrieval systems. They are synthesizing systems, with no ability to discern from the data it's trained on unless significant guardrails are put in place."

### The Bubble Parallel

Projections of AI becoming a trillion-dollar industry within a decade sound reminiscent of dot-com and crypto bubbles.

**Gary Marcus on the timeline:**
> "It's easy to say, 'Oh, we're just a few months away.' I don't think that we are in this particular case. Not because I don't think AI is or AGI is impossible, but just because [this] particular technology has a lot of problems."

### Environmental Cost

The hardware that generative AI uses needs enormous amounts of energy - an often-overlooked cost that adds to the ROI problem.
