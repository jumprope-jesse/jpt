# Browser Privacy Tools

Tools and extensions for managing privacy, cookies, and tracking in web browsers.

## Cookie Consent Management

### Reject Cookies (Chrome Extension)
- **URL**: https://blog.bymitch.com/posts/reject-cookies/
- **GitHub**: Open source
- **Purpose**: Auto-reject non-essential cookies (not auto-accept like most alternatives)
- **How it works**: Targets specific cookie consent vendors (OneTrust, etc.) with selectors, attempts rejection first, falls back to removing the banner
- **Differentiator**: Most extensions auto-accept cookies; this one rejects non-essential cookies to maintain privacy

### Alternatives
- **I Don't Care About Cookies** - Auto-accepts cookies (less privacy-focused)
- **I Still Don't Care About Cookies** - Open source fork of above
- **uBlock Origin** - Can add filters to hide cookie popups
- **Privacy Badger** - Blocks cookie trackers

## Regulatory Context
Under GDPR and ePrivacy Directive, omission of acceptance should be equivalent to explicit rejection - making auto-reject tools legally sound.
