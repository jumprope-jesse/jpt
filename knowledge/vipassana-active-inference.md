## Core Thesis

Suffering arises from prediction error - the gap between our expectations (shaped by preferences) and reality. Vipassana meditation retrains the mind's default response from craving/aversion to equanimity, reducing unnecessary prediction error.

## Active Inference Basics

**Generative models**: We constantly predict our environment. The brain minimizes "free energy" (discrepancy between predictions and observations) via:
1. Updating the world model with new information
2. Taking action to bring the world in line with predictions

**Preferences shape the model**: Our world model isn't just accurate - it's biased toward states that satisfy our preferences (survival, flourishing). Everything we perceive gets tagged with positive/negative/neutral valence relative to our goals.

**Precision and attention**: Attention modulates how fine-grained our predictions are. High precision = more detailed predictions = faster hypothesis testing.

## The Chain of Suffering

1. External event occurs
2. Nerves register sensations
3. Automatic reaction occurs
4. Craving (wanting what isn't) or aversion (rejecting what is) arises
5. Suffering is experienced

**Key insight**: Craving and aversion generate unnecessary prediction error because they produce predictions of worlds that are fundamentally counter to reality.

## Vipassana Practice

**Method**: Observe bodily sensations without reacting. No positive or negative response - just curiosity about shape, texture, intensity.

**What happens**: Painful sensations arise during sitting. Eventually they dissolve on their own. The insight (Anicca/impermanence) is that feelings come and go without our intervention. Our *reactions* cause suffering, not the sensations themselves.

**Mechanism**: As you observe a sensation with precision without reacting, your model becomes extremely well-calibrated to it. Perfect prediction = no error = the sensation "collapses" into subtle vibrations.

## Why It Generalizes

All external experiences pass through the gate of bodily sensation - physical pain, emotional reactions, social situations. By retraining your response at the sensation level, you modify reactions to all the external phenomena that produce similar sensations.

The meditator still experiences prediction error when unexpected things happen. The difference is rapid recovery - quickly updating the model to incorporate new reality rather than persisting in craving/aversion.

## Suffering Defined

> "Suffering is the state which arises from updating one's model to include fewer positive experiences in future or more negative experiences."

This explains why exercise or extreme sports can involve pain without suffering - you're updating toward more positive future states.

**Chronic suffering**: World model expects something good but consistently observes otherwise (e.g., dysfunctional behavior patterns). Priors get trapped.

## Practical Implications

- Experienced meditators aren't immune to suffering - they recover faster
- The goal is continuous observation throughout daily life, not just during sitting
- Working at the sensation level is efficient because you can't distinguish physical vs emotional vs social causes
- Dissociation and harmful outcomes are possible - approach with care and guidance

- Shannon entropy / surprisal
- Sankhara (stored reactions in Buddhist psychology)

## Open Questions

- Can you deliberately change reactions as they occur? (Debated in ActInf literature)
- Are specific sensations actually tied to specific psychological complexes? (Author skeptical but notes personal experience)
- How does this framework apply to other techniques (Metta, Anapana)?
