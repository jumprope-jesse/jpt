# Nonprofit Industrial Complex Critique

Source: American Affairs Journal (Summer 2024) - "The Nonprofit Industrial Complex and the Corruption of the American City"

## Core Thesis

The term "nonprofit" is effectively marketing propaganda that grants organizations unwarranted moral credibility while shielding them from scrutiny. Many nonprofits operate contrary to their stated mission.

## Key Patterns of Dysfunction

### Perverse Incentives in Affordable Housing
- Affordable housing nonprofits benefit financially when rents rise (subsidies increase)
- Example: San Francisco's TODCO - hasn't developed housing in 20 years but spends millions lobbying *against* new housing construction
- Seattle's Housing Development Consortium lobbied against public social housing to protect member organizations' funding

### Lack of Oversight
- Cities pay millions to nonprofits with minimal accountability
- San Francisco paid $25M to charities that were delinquent/suspended
- Nonprofits can hire people government agencies couldn't (convicted felons as "violence interrupters" who commit more crimes)

### The "Progressive Doom Loop"
1. Progressive cities underfund core government agencies
2. Services outsourced to "community-based organizations" (nonprofits)
3. Multiple nonprofits inherently less efficient than one government agency (weak oversight, no economies of scale)
4. High taxes but poor services
5. Population exodus -> shrinking tax base -> more cuts -> accelerating decline

## Statistics Cited
- SF homeless spending: $200M (2016) -> $1.1B (2021), yet ~1000 more homeless than 2015
- SF spent $5.8B on private contracts (40%+ of spending) while Houston's entire budget was $5.7B
- Portland: European-level taxes, third-world state capacity

## Contrarian Take
The author argues these cities aren't failing because they're "too socialist" - they're failing because they **aren't socialist enough**. They privatize government services through nonprofits instead of building actual state capacity.

## Relevance
- Framework for evaluating nonprofit claims and impact
- Understanding urban governance dysfunction
- The gap between stated mission and actual incentives in organizations
