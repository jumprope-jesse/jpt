## Web-to-App Converters

### Coherence X5
**URL:** https://www.bzgapps.com/coherence
**Status:** Evaluating / Running

Transforms websites into standalone Mac apps. Instead of running in a cluttered browser window, sites become standalone, lightweight apps — isolated for focus and security, yet powered by Chrome's speed and flexibility.

**Key Features:**
- Creates true Mac apps from URLs (not just browser shortcuts)
- Each app can have its own extensions, profiles, and settings
- Supports multiple Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
- Two app modes:
  - **Standard apps**: Single, distraction-free window
  - **Tabbed apps**: Full browser with tab support (good for grouping related tools like Gmail, Calendar, Drive)
- **Link Forwarding**: Control which links open in app vs default browser
- Proper Dock behavior (click icon reopens/launches correctly)
- Icon customization tools
- App library management

**Use Cases:**
- Isolate work Gmail from personal Gmail
- Create dedicated apps for self-hosted services (Plex, TrueNAS, Proxmox)
- Make web apps like Office 365, Miro feel native
- Maintain work/home boundaries by isolating apps
- Works with USB Yubikey for MFA

**Related:** BZG also makes "Unite" for Safari-based web apps

**Built for:** macOS 26 Tahoe
