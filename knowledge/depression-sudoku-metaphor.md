# Depression Explained: The Sudoku Metaphor

Source: [LessWrong - What Depression Is Like](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/H65uLxFGPuBDLoTso/what-depression-is-like)

A helpful metaphor for understanding and explaining depression to others.

## The Core Metaphor

Imagine an app installed in your brain that forces you to solve a mild Sudoku puzzle before doing *anything*. Not hard puzzles - just annoying ones that take nonzero effort.

## Two Dimensions of Worsening

### Dimension 1: Granularity
As depression worsens, actions fragment into smaller pieces, each requiring its own puzzle:
- Initially: solve one puzzle to "go to work"
- Later: separate puzzles for getting dressed, getting in car, driving, starting work
- Eventually: individual puzzles for opening eyes, sitting up, swinging legs, standing

### Dimension 2: Quantity
The number of puzzles per action increases over time:
- First: 1 puzzle per action
- Then: 2, 3, 5, 10, 50...

## Why This Metaphor Works

The puzzles aren't *difficult* - they're **boring** and **unrewarding**:
- No learning, no growth, no engagement
- Just chores blocking access to actual life
- Even puzzle-lovers would be drained by hundreds daily

## Indirect Consequences

The real damage is anticipating this state extending into the future:
- Apathy develops from chronic disappointment
- "What's the point of trying today?"
- Leads to staying in bed, stopping hygiene, withdrawing from relationships

## Useful For

- Explaining depression to people who haven't experienced it
- Understanding why depressed people struggle with "simple" tasks
- Building empathy for colleagues/friends who seem disengaged
