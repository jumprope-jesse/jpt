# US Trade and Tariff Policy Framework

*Source: [Stratechery - A Chance to Build](https://stratechery.com/2024/a-chance-to-build/) by Ben Thompson, Nov 2024*

## The Post-WWII Order

### Bretton Woods (1944)
- Exchange rates pegged to US dollar
- Devastated economies of Europe/Japan rebuilt via US capital
- Lower labor costs attracted manufacturing
- Currency peg prevented US dollar depreciation
- Made US debt attractive for reinvestment

### After Bretton Woods Collapse (1971)
The structure persisted:
- Trade denominated in dollars (reserve currency)
- US dollar value stays higher than economics would dictate
- Attractive debt → deficit spending → consumer spending → imports
- Import profits → reinvested in US debt → funds military
- Cycle repeats

**Winners:** US consumers (cheap imports, service jobs)
**Losers:** US manufacturing workers

## Key Trade Agreements

### Information Technology Agreement (ITA), 1996
- WTO agreement eliminating tariffs on IT products including chips
- Critical enabler of zero-friction global hardware supply chains
- At risk under Trump tariff proposals

### Trump's Tariff Proposals (2024)
From GOP Platform and campaign:
- 60% tariffs on all Chinese goods
- 20% baseline tariffs on everything else
- Smoot-Hawley Act authorities may be invoked
- Goal: undo 80 years of structural changes

## Recent Tariff Actions

### Biden EV Tariffs (May 2024)
- Total tariff on Chinese EVs: 27.5% → 102.5%
- Direct impact: Waymo's Zeekr partnership cancelled
- Waymo shifted to Hyundai IONIQ 5 (US-manufactured, less purpose-built)

## The "Build" Opportunity

### What Makes Tariffs Potentially Different Now

**Automation + AI changes the equation:**
- Robotics decreases marginal cost of physical goods
- Software-defined manufacturing platforms possible
- "Dark factories" (fully automated) becoming viable
- Don't need to recreate 1960s labor economics

**Tesla's Vertical Integration:**
- Builds own hardware, software, and many components
- Manufacturing automation struggles show difficulty
- Long-term threat from modular Chinese approach
- Doubling down on autonomy as response

**Amazon's Automation Model:**
- Heavy investment in fulfillment center robotics
- Decreases marginal cost of picking
- Enables low-margin "Everyday Essentials" category
- Drones and self-driving for delivery automation

### The Modular Platform Future

Chinese model emerging in EVs:
- Xiaomi: Consumer electronics company making SUVs
- Design + tech integration in-house
- Manufacturing contracted to Beijing Auto Group
- Huawei: Similar arrangements with Seres, Changan, Chery

Future could look like computing:
- Rack, desktop, laptop, phone = same chips/software
- Self-driving cars: taxi, group transport, office, sleeper
- Modular platforms, software-defined functionality

## Strategic Assessment

### Risks
1. Tariffs damage US tech golden goose
2. More expensive hardware constricts software market
3. ITA violations enable retaliation against US tech
4. US companies become popular targets abroad

### Opportunities
1. National security market as anchor customer
2. Self-driving car manufacturing as proving ground
3. Build automation-first, not labor-first
4. Software-defined modularity at the core

### Realistic Expectations
- System remade in decades, not years
- Political and economic pain required
- Most likely: lots of noise, less change
- War could accelerate systemic change (hopefully avoided)

> "The symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley software makers and Asian hardware manufacturers is one of the most potent economic combinations in history, and it may be impossible to compete with; if it's ever going to work, though, the best opportunity—absent a war, God forbid—is probably right now."
