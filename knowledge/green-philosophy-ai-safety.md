## The Color Wheel Framework

Carlsmith finds the Magic the Gathering Color Wheel more useful than personality typologies like Myers-Briggs or Enneagram because it has "archetypal resonance":

| Color | Association | Core Drive |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| White | Morality | Order, rules, community |
| Blue | Knowledge | Understanding, perfection |
| Black | Power | Self-interest, pragmatism |
| Red | Passion | Freedom, emotion, action |
| Green | Nature | Balance, harmony, acceptance |

## What is Green?

Green represents:
- Environmentalism, tradition, family, spirituality
- Wholesomeness, health, "yin" energy
- Acceptance of limitations, humility before Nature
- Taking joy in otherness rather than seeking total control
- The "conservative" color - respecting what has survived

**Key literary touchstone**: Ursula LeGuin's *Wizard of Earthsea* - Ogion the Silent who "let the rain fall" rather than ward it off with magic. His teaching: "To hear, you must be silent."

LeGuin's formulation:
> "To reconstruct the world, to rebuild or rationalize it, is to run the risk of losing or destroying what in fact is."

## Green-Blindness in AI Safety Discourse

Carlsmith observes that Effective Altruism and Rationalism are notably **non-green**:

- EA is centrally white, blue, and black
- Rationality (as ideology) is centrally blue and black
- Green is often seen as "one of the main mistakes"

**Green's apparent failures according to these ideologies:**
- Told rationalists to be more OK with death
- Told EAs to be more OK with wild animal suffering
- Thinks Nature is a harmony that humans disrupt
- Tends to passivity when EA/rationalism seek agency and optimization

**But**: Yudkowsky's AI risk warnings are structurally green:
- Warning against "summoning the demon" through too much blue-black ambition
- Concern about AIs "beating the universe black and blue"
- AIs as "invasive species" in the existing ecosystem
- The "notkilleveryone" concern is about protecting the existing ecosystem from monoculture

## Green's Wisdom That Non-Green Misses

### Green-According-to-Blue
Blue thinks green is worried about inadequate knowledge - acting without understanding complex systems. This is true but incomplete.

### Green-According-to-Black
Black thinks green is about accepting what you're too weak to change. This misses that green takes *joy* in yin, not just resignation.

### Green-According-to-White
White thinks green is about following moral rules in relation to Nature. But green's "respect" goes beyond rights-talk.

### What Green Actually Adds

**1. Respect beyond rights:**
- Why does cutting down an ancient redwood feel wrong, even if the tree isn't a "moral patient" in the standard sense?
- There's a dimension of "presence" and "dignity" that doesn't reduce to consciousness, rights, or utility
- This applies to superintelligent emissaries too - some dimension of respect beyond "you have power" and "you are a moral patient"

**2. Joy in otherness:**
- Love is directed at something outside yourself - present but exceeding your grasp
- Wonder, sublimity, beauty - all involve receiving something outside yourself
- Partner dancing, surfing, certain kinds of sex - play of yin and yang with a not-fully-controlled Other
- Our deepest values are animated by joy in Otherness, not just by mastery

**3. The parental story:**
God rejected the throne of pure yang - chose to create free Others rather than control everything. Even if we criticize this choice, it points at something real: we don't always want more power and control.

## Implications for AGI Futures

**The underrated threat:**
Not just that we'll have too little yang (AI overpowers us), but that we might have too much yang (lose the joys of Otherness).

Classic concern about Utopia: What does life become if most aspects can be chosen and controlled? Where will we seek wildness if the world has been tamed?

**Solarpunk/cozy futurism resonance:**
Transhumanist visions read as cold when they lose touch with green. Give the future plants, fresh air, mountain-sides, sunlight - and people warm to it.

> "If a future of nano-bot-onium is pure yang, pure top-down control, gardens seem an interesting alternative - a mix of yin and yang; of your work, and God's, intertwined and harmonized."

## Green and Attunement (Next Essay Preview)

Carlsmith cares most about "attunement" - something distinct from blue's "knowledge":
- Not just knowing facts about the world
- But being in harmony with it, responding appropriately
- More on this in his next essay

## Relevance to AI Safety Technical Work

Attempts to formalize the "green" we want from AIs:
- Soft optimization
- Corrigibility
- Low impact agents

Yudkowsky has declared defeat on this research direction - says these vibes are "anti-natural" to sufficiently smart agents that get things done. But maybe the problem is green-blindness, not green-incoherence.

---

## The Naturalistic Fallacy Problem

Green often gets dismissed via the naturalistic fallacy - you can't derive "ought" from "is."

But Carlsmith notes:
1. Deep atheists also have this problem - where does their "ought" attach if everything is Nature?
2. Yudkowskian ethics ultimately grounds in "resonance" - which is also just God/Nature creating certain responses
3. The question isn't whether to take input from God, but which parts

## Key Quotes

On green-blindness:
> "These ideological orientations can be so anti-green that I worry they won't be able to see whatever wisdom green has to offer; that green will seem either incomprehensible, or like a simple mistake."

On joy in otherness:
> "A lot of our deepest values are animated by taking certain kinds of joy in otherness and yin—in being not-God, and relatedly: not-alone."

On futures:
> "Hopefully, while still using the future's rough magic wisely, rather than breaking staff and drowning book."

## Personal Relevance

This essay provides a philosophical frame for:
1. Understanding why certain AI safety concerns feel "right" even when hard to formalize
2. Why solarpunk/cozy futurism resonates more than chrome-and-blue transhumanism
3. The value of conservation, tradition, and acceptance alongside optimization
4. Why "just maximize utility" feels like it's missing something important
