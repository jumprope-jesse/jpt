# Alternative Cancer Care & Combination Therapy

*Source: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6p7GATvGYQp4TFFKY/alternative-cancer-care-as-biohacking-and-book-review - Added: 2026-01-18*

A LessWrong post arguing that alternative cancer care can be rigorous biohacking rather than quackery, centered on a book review of "Surviving Terminal Cancer" by Ben Williams.

## Core Arguments

### The Combination Therapy Thesis

1. **Cancer is heterogeneous** - Inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity means cancer is a collection of diseases, even within a single tumor
2. **Monotherapy won't cure cancer** - "Silver bullet" solutions fail; need protocols combining multiple treatment modalities, drug cocktails, and lifestyle optimizations targeting multiple vulnerabilities
3. **Bottleneck is testing speed** - Protocols aren't designed to be tested as protocols; local search adds/replaces single agents one at a time
4. **Commercial incentives misaligned** - Pharmaceutical companies sponsor trials, so promising unpatentable treatments are excluded

### HIV Treatment Parallel

From Williams' book (key insight):

> "The HIV virus and cancer cells are biological entities that mutate rapidly. Because mutations can develop resistance to treatment agents, treatments for these diseases often seem effective at first, but may become less effective over time."

The successful HIV cocktail wasn't developed through phase 3 trials - it gained FDA approval through patient activism. Cancer treatment needs similar paradigm shift.

## Ben Williams Case Study

UCSD psychology professor diagnosed with "terminal" glioblastoma in 1995, became 30-year survivor through self-medication alongside standard of care.

### His Protocol (developed iteratively):

| Compound | Mechanism | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Tamoxifen | Protein kinase C suppression | Had to force oncologist to prescribe; bought extra in Tijuana |
| Verapamil | Calcium channel blocker (blocks drug efflux pumps) | Got from internist after oncologist refused |
| Accutane | Blocks epidermal growth factor receptors | Bought in Tijuana; timed around chemo cycles |
| Melatonin | Broad immune system booster | Italian trial showed doubled survival |
| PSK (mushroom extract) | Immune enhancement | Japanese trials; mail order from Oregon |
| GLA (borage seed oil) | Free-radical release | Indian glioma study |

**Key insight on interaction risk**: Different mechanisms of action (GLA's free radicals, PSK/melatonin immune enhancement, accutane blocking EGFR, tamoxifen suppressing PKC) = limited antagonistic interaction risk.

### Results

- Tumor progressively shrank over multiple MRIs
- Achieved complete response (tumor disappeared)
- Became his oncologist's first glioblastoma cure
- Still alive 30 years later

## CUSP9v3 Clinical Trial

Dr. Marc-Eric Halatsch's experimental glioblastoma protocol using 9 repurposed generic drugs:
- aprepitant, auranofin, celecoxib, captopril, disulfiram, itraconazole, minocycline, ritonavir, sertraline

**Results (Phase 1/2):**
- 10 patients with recurrent GBM
- 5 progressed quickly (died in 1.5-7 months)
- 5 had PFS of 12+ months
- 3 had complete response (vs 1/49 in single-agent trial)
- 2 of the 3 long-term survivors later died after protocol cessation

**Timeline indictment**: Idea proposed 2013 → Phase 1/2 started 2016 → Results published 2021 → Phase 3 anticipated 2026. 13 years from idea to phase 3.

## Systemic Failures Identified

1. **FDA catch-22**: Doctors won't recommend without approval; can't establish efficacy without recommendation; no incentive to run expensive trials for generics
2. **Standard of care protection**: Malpractice law penalizes innovation; oncologists stick to protocols even when failing
3. **Closed epistemology**: "Unproven" label blocks drugs with favorable cost-benefit profiles
4. **Terminal patient paradox**: People with nothing to lose denied access to cheap, safe drugs with theoretical justification

### Williams' Proposed Solution

National Cancer Institute database tracking:
- Longitudinal patient outcomes
- Treatment protocols
- Patient profiles

Use standard-of-care median outcomes as control. Allow terminal patients access to promising phase 2 drugs without phase 3 confirmation.

## Key Quotes

> "The systematic failures of oncology stem from a lack of doctors, regulators and patients willing to think independently."

> "Maybe the reason the war on cancer failed is because we fought it like the invasion of Afghanistan."
