## Classic Recursion Jokes

**The Index Entry**: Having an index entry at the back of a book that says "Recursion, Page 251" where the entry itself is on page 251. Particularly funny because the page number isn't known at writing time—requires coordination between author and printer.

**Google's Version**: Search "recursion" on Google and it suggests "Did you mean: recursion?"

**The Shampoo Joke**: "A programmer's wife tells him to go to the store: 'Buy a loaf of bread. If they have eggs, buy a dozen.' He comes home with 12 loaves of bread."

Better version (actual recursion): "Lather, Rinse, Repeat" - Grace Hopper reportedly joked about running out of shampoo. This is funnier because:
1. It's literalism (computers take things literally)
2. Uses indirection (listener must reason about *why* she ran out)
3. Teaches about resource exhaustion (stack overflow, out of memory, etc.)

**LISP Joke** (from "A Brief, Incomplete, and Mostly Wrong History of Programming Languages"):
> "LISP is invented. It uses recursion and condescension."

Works because "recursion" and "condescension" rhyme, and the dig at LISP programmers is arguably true.

## The Droste Effect

The visual recursion phenomenon where a picture contains a smaller version of itself, ad infinitum.

**Named after**: Droste cocoa powder boxes featuring a nurse carrying a tray with a cup of hot chocolate and a box of Droste Cocoa Powder, which shows a nurse carrying...

**Famous examples**:
- Pink Floyd's "Ummagumma" album cover (Australian reproductions were too poor to see the innermost image)
- XKCD #668
- "The Stanley Parable" game cover
- Andy Griffiths/Terry Denton's "Treehouse" book series
- The "Airplane!" movie

## Related Paradoxes

**Self-referential statements**: The cleverest paradoxes require sophisticated inquiry to see how a statement refers to itself.

**Time travel paradoxes**:
- Spontaneous creation (give younger self a hat you've had since childhood)
- Impossible destruction (grandfather paradox)
- Can result in infinite regress when trying to unravel

**Circular references**: Following reference A leads you back to A. Classic example in Excel where A1=B1 and B1=A1 creates a "live lock."

**Grid lock**: Traffic queue A blocks B which blocks C which blocks A. Resolution often requires counterintuitive moves (letting blocking vehicle through first).

## The Trouble With Tribbles

A Star Trek example of unbounded exponential growth—tribbles consume all available resources as they reproduce without bound. Perfect metaphor for runaway recursion consuming stack space.

## Perpetual Motion as Recursion

A machine that uses its own motion to fuel its own motion while performing work—the physical analog of trying to create energy from nothing through self-reference.
