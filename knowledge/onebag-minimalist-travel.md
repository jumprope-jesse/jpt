## Philosophy

Living with only what fits in a laptop backpack since 2015. Key principles:
- Own only what you need
- Focus more, spend less, travel spontaneously
- Traveling without luggage removes every pain point of flying
- Buy only what you need; a $100 setup is nearly as good as $10,000
- Function over brand names
- Stay longer in cities for productivity, finances, and relationships
- "Zero-bag" trips possible when based somewhere (just pocket contents)

## Bags

- **Aer Slim Pack** (9L) - perfect for personal item size on budget airlines
- **Rains Pencil Case** - dopp kit for toiletries/first aid
- Always include an Airtag; use S-biners on zippers for casual theft prevention

## Tech

- MacBook Air M2 13" (wishes for ultralight laptop return)
- iPhone 15 Pro 256GB (no case, AppleCare)
- Apple Watch S7 (health/workout tracking only)
- AirPods Pro 2 (noise cancellation essential for travel)
- Samsung USB-C thumb drives (256GB x2) - one in pocket, one in bag
- Backup iPhone 7 in backpack

## Charging

- Apple USB-C woven cable (1m) - charges everything except watch
- Apple Watch Fast Charger (only Apple cables charge at max speed)
- Anker PowerCore 20,000mAh battery - one full MacBook charge, fits in pocket

## Clothing Strategy

**"Day Rolls"**: Roll shirts around socks and underwear into compact bundles
- Prevents wrinkling
- Eliminates decision-making when getting dressed
- Simple packing: toss rolls into bag

**Shirts**: 6 when traveling, 12 if staying somewhere
- American Apparel 50/50 cotton/poly preferred over triblends (durability)
- Avoid merino (durability issues, expensive)

**Socks**: Darn Tough merino (6 pairs)
- Lifetime warranty - they'll replace if they rip
- 5,000+ miles per pair, still look new

**Underwear**: Uniqlo Airism Boxer Briefs (6 pairs)
- Get regular version, not low-rise or seamless
- Usually only in-store

**Pants**: Western Rise AT pants
- Heavy material, comfortable yet durable
- Grip6 belt (minimalist, gunmetal)

**Shoes**: Nike Pegasus Trail 5
- Skip Gore-Tex version (uncomfortable in heat)
- S-biners on laces for attaching to belt (beach walking)

## Winter Additions

- **Montbell Plasma 1000** - world's best down jacket by weight-to-warmth; weighs less than a phone, fits in pocket
- **Canvas jacket** - worn weight, not packed weight; layer over hoodie + Montbell
- Pullover hoodie (cheap, gets destroyed on hikes)
- Arc'teryx Alpha SL gloves
- Merino Buff - face mask, sleep mask, scarf, bandana, pillowcase

## Essentials

- RE:FORM RE:01 wallet (magnetic Airtag pouch)
- Cheap polarized sunglasses
- True Utility Keytool (bottle opener, 10+ years daily carry)
- A.Brolly umbrella (<90g)
- Matador Nanodry shower towel (fits in fist, beach towel size)
- Moleskine (blank pages)
- First aid in Altoids tin

## Backpacking Additions (4.4 lbs total)

For PCT, mountain trips:
- 3F UL Gear tent ($70 ultralight)
- Sleeping bag liner
- Thermarest NeoAir Uberlite (small, weighs less than phone)
- Nitecore NU25 UL headlamp (USB-C charged)
- Sawyer Mini water filter (most critical item)
- Smartwater 1L bottles (x2)

**Airport considerations**: Carbon fiber stakes/poles can sometimes sneak through security but not reliable.

## Key Insights

1. **Weight matters**: 4oz jacket over 1lb jacket
2. **Consumerism trap**: Travel/hiking communities focus on expensive brands over practicality
3. **Perfect gear doesn't exist**: Stop obsessing
4. **Worn weight vs packed weight**: Heavy jackets work if you wear them on flights
5. **Consideration list**: Don't impulse buy - maintain a list and only buy items that have been on it for a while
