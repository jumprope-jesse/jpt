## Background: Rationalist Culture

The rationality community emerged from early 2000s blogs:

**Overcoming Bias** (2006): Founded by Robin Hanson (Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute) and Eliezer Yudkowsky. Dedicated to understanding cognitive biases and training better thinking.

**LessWrong** (2009): Yudkowsky's spinoff blog. Core premise: we can hack our "monkey-brains" to run better neurological software. Attracted STEM-focused autodidacts, higher-than-average share on the autism spectrum.

**Slate Star Codex** (2013): Scott Alexander (Bay Area psychiatrist). Attracted serious commenters devoted to "truth for truth's sake."

### Rationalist Shibboleths

- Nothing—not social niceties, political correctness, or emotion—should get between humans and apprehending reality
- Tolerating controversial commenters (including Mencius Moldbug/Curtis Yarvin) because free debate was paramount
- "Safe spaces" of social justice left seen as antithetical to the rationalist ethos

### Institutional Expansion

- **Center for Applied Rationality** (CFAR, Berkeley 2012): "Raise the sanity waterline"
- **Machine Intelligence Research Institute** (MIRI): Yudkowsky's AI safety org, Peter Thiel donated $1M+
- **Effective Altruism movement**: Maximize utility through calculations, usually via high-earning tech/finance careers + donations
- Rationalist group houses, polyamorous households modeling "rational principles of good living"

### Cultural Influence

- Rationalist culture became intertwined with Silicon Valley founder culture
- Elon Musk met Grimes over a rationalist meme
- *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* (Yudkowsky's 700k-word fanfic) was a major recruiting tool

## The Postrationalist Turn

### Sources of Disillusionment

**Former CFAR employee Leah Libresco Sargeant** (now Catholic): The rationalists had a word for spiritual yearnings—"pica" (like the compulsion to eat dirt, often signaling nutritional deficiency). "When people respond to something, there's some hunger here."

**Former Centre for Effective Altruism director**: Initially thought "we're going to figure out exactly where money should go." But grew disillusioned—effective altruism "depowered a lot of people. It made them less interesting and vibrant as people, and more like—trying to fit into a slightly soulless bureaucracy of good-doing."

**Tyler Alterman** (former EA growth director): Describes his experience as a "vitamin deficiency." Took crushing depression and severe illness to realize "these things that I deemed to be irrational or, like, useless types of creativity, were essential to my functioning."

### Key Insight: Intuition as Epistemic Tool

Alterman: "It turns out that intuition is incredibly powerful... an incredibly powerful epistemic tool that it just seems like a lot of rationalists weren't using because it falls into this domain of 'woo stuff.'"

## The Metatribe

Tyler Alterman declared 2020 the "dawn of the metatribe" (term from Peter Limberg's Intellectual Explorers Club podcast).

### Characteristics

> "The metatribe is neither nihilist nor locked onto an ethical system. It has political opinions without being left, right, or center... metatribers often appear to be 'heterodox.' The metatribe is scientific without scientism. It is spiritual while being neither new age nor traditionally religious."

Other names for the phenomenon:
- "This part of Twitter" (TPOT)
- The liminal web
- The sense-making web
- The intellectual deep web

### Key Figures

**Bloggers:**
- Venkatesh Rao (Ribbonfarm)
- Sarah Perry (Ribbonfarm, author of *Every Cradle Is a Grave*)
- David Chapman (Meaningness)

**Twitter personalities:**
- eigenrobot (43k followers)
- Zero H.P. Lovecraft (98k followers)
- Prince Vogelfrei

### Practices

- Vajrayana Buddhism
- Tarot
- Shadow work (psychological-meets-spiritual self-examination)
- Custom rituals (e.g., Rebecca Fox's "psychospiritual technology")
- Historical European martial arts
- Traditionalism (esoteric/occult school of thought)

## Philosophical Framework

### John Vervaeke's "Meaning Crisis"

Vervaeke (cognitive scientist, U of Toronto): Modern rationality has lost what ancient concepts like *logos* and *ratio* actually meant—bound up with wisdom, practice, the imaginal, ritual, transformation, aspiration.

> "Our Cartesian reduction of rationality to computational abilities, and then the reduction of that to just communication and communicative manipulation—we have lost a lot."

Wisdom requires community: "You have to acquire identities and roles and responsibilities and virtues... That takes a community that is willing to hang with you for a long time, which means the best shot of finding such a community is one that has a tradition and a history behind it."

### David Chapman's "Meaningness"

> "Meaning is real but not definite. It is neither objective nor subjective. It is neither given by an external force nor a human invention."

Takes from eternalism: humans should experience the world as meaningful
Takes from nihilism: no single "eternal source of meaning"

### Sarah Perry's Key Maxim

> "It is better to be interesting and wrong than it is to be right and boring."

On rituals: "There's no One True Ritual Order that's going to survive forever. The best hope is maybe there are micronutrients or vitamins that we can discover, and then figure out how to supply them under different technological regimes."

## The Central Tension

**@bigmastertroll on postrationalism:**

> "There's a sense where modernity is kind of great, because sacredness leads to irrationality, problems, wars etc. That maybe trading off a bit of guaranteed meaning for more choice, warm homes and less violence... is actually a pretty good deal. At the same time, [postrationalists] are basically all mourning the loss of enchantment."

> "In a way, you can summarise post rationality, as, like, 'how do you get the sacred without violence.'"

### Critique: Still Liberal Individualism

Leah Libresco Sargeant notes the metatribe treats religion like psychedelics—tools for self-development, not truth claims:

> "I think religion is very powerful and it's interesting that religious people have greater life satisfaction. So should I try doing religion like it's recreational drugs to see where that takes me?"

This is spirituality for a secular age: "anchored by the conviction that reality is downstream of our personal psychological power."

## The Shared Core: Human Godliness

Both rationalists and postrationalists share faith in human transformative potential.

**Rationalist version** (Yudkowsky's Harry in HPMOR): "wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god"—through superior reasoning.

**Postrationalist version** (Prince Vogelfrei): "Both Nietzscheanism and the occult discourse... and even modern rationality: a thread through all of these things is the implicit desire to become a god."

The difference is methodology, not ambition.

## Related Intellectual Currents

**Neo-Jungianism** (Jordan Peterson): Myth, ritual, relationship to the sacred as antidote to postmodern alienation

**TikTok progressive spirituality**: Witchcraft, activism, sage cleansing, "manifesting"

**New Right esotericism**: Blood-and-soil nationalists, Julius Evola readers, Steve Bannon's Traditionalism, sedevacantist Catholic podcasters

## Key Takeaways

1. **Rationalist culture's utilitarianism left many hungry** for meaning, beauty, community—the "vitamin deficiency"
2. **Intuition has epistemic value** that rationalism dismissed as "woo"
3. **Wisdom requires community and tradition** (Vervaeke), not just individual optimization
4. **The metatribe bridges spiritual and secular** but remains committed to personal autonomy
5. **Both movements share faith in human self-transcendence**—different tools, same goal
6. **The challenge: how to get sacred meaning without the violence** historically associated with it
