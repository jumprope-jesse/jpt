## Context

Barlow wrote these principles at 2am the night before turning 30, shocked to have survived that long when many of his friends had not. He wanted behavioral goals to help him "at least act like" a grown-up without becoming one "in the toxic and stultifying sense."

> "I don't expect the perfect attainment of these principles. However, I post them as a standard for my conduct as an adult. Should any of my friends or colleagues catch me violating any one of them, bust me."

## The 25 Principles

1. **Be patient. No matter what.**

2. **Don't badmouth:**
   - Assign responsibility, never blame.
   - Say nothing behind another's back you'd be unwilling to say, in exactly the same tone and language, to his face.

3. **Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.**

4. **Expand your sense of the possible.**

5. **Don't trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.**

6. **Expect no more of anyone than you yourself can deliver.**

7. **Tolerate ambiguity.**

8. **Laugh at yourself frequently.**

9. **Concern yourself with what is right rather than whom is right.**

10. **Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.**

11. **Give up blood sports.**

12. **Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Do not endanger it frivolously. And never endanger the life of another.**

13. **Never lie to anyone for any reason.**

14. **Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.**

15. **Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.**

16. **Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.**

17. **Praise at least as often as you disparage.**

18. **Never let your errors pass without admission.**

19. **Become less suspicious of joy.**

20. **Understand humility.**

21. **Forgive.**

22. **Foster dignity.**

23. **Live memorably.**

24. **Love yourself.**

25. **Endure.**

## Themes

### On Personal Responsibility
- #3 (charitable interpretation), #5 (sphere of control), #6 (reciprocal expectations), #10 (epistemic humility), #18 (admitting errors)

### On Relationships
- #2 (no badmouthing), #14 (learn others' needs), #16 (reduce self-focus), #17 (praise/disparage ratio), #21 (forgiveness)

### On Character
- #1 (patience), #7 (tolerate ambiguity), #8 (self-deprecation), #19 (openness to joy), #20 (humility)

### On Purpose
- #4 (expand the possible), #15 (mission over happiness), #22 (dignity), #23 (live memorably), #25 (endure)

## Notable Principles

**#15 - "Avoid the pursuit of happiness"** - This cuts against both hedonic treadmill and the self-help industry. Barlow's alternative: define a mission and pursue that. Purpose over pleasure.

**#3 - Charitable interpretation** - Assume others believe their motives are as noble as you believe yours are. This doesn't mean their motives *are* noble—only that you should extend the same interpretive charity to others that you extend to yourself.

**#7 - Tolerate ambiguity** - Relevant for entrepreneurship, parenting, and any complex domain. Resist the urge to resolve uncertainty prematurely.

**#12 - Your life belongs to others** - A counter to radical individualism. Your choices affect those who depend on you.

## Connection to Other Ideas

- **Relates to Stoic philosophy**: #5 (sphere of control) echoes Epictetus, but Barlow's full list isn't pure Stoicism—#19 ("become less suspicious of joy") and #25 ("endure") suggest active engagement rather than detachment
- **Relates to engineering leadership**: #9 (what is right vs. who is right), #10 (epistemic humility), #18 (admitting errors) are directly applicable
- **Complements self-help critique**: These are personal principles without the "reconcile yourself to precarity" undertones that Baker critiques
