## The Three Cs of Spirals

Self-defeating spirals follow a predictable pattern with three key components:

### 1. Core Questions
Fundamental questions that define identity, belonging, and adequacy:
- Who am I?
- Do I belong?
- Am I enough?

These questions are often latent—settled for long periods, then flaring up at critical junctures to shape perception and behavior.

### 2. Construal (Meaning-Making)
We don't see the world objectively—we *read* it, drawing inferences based on what's already in our heads. Like the professor demo: students primed with "travel to Libya" heard "Tripoli"; those primed with "shoe sizes" heard "Triple E."

**The threat bias**: We're especially attuned to what could threaten us. In a forest where a tiger prowls, every rustle sounds like the tiger. In social situations, when core questions are unsettled, every ambiguous cue becomes potential proof of our fears.

**Confirmation bias in action**: We're not neutral observers. When anxious about belonging, we seek evidence that corroborates our fears—even the tiniest negative signals while screening out positive ones.

### 3. Calcification
Negative thoughts become entrenched through our own actions:
1. Have bad date → Think "Am I unlovable?"
2. Next date goes poorly (self-fulfilling prophecy)
3. Rinse and repeat → Romantic rut

The spiral accelerates: fail test → stop going to class → fail more. Feel sick from treatment → avoid treatment → get sicker.

## The Spiral Anatomy (Workplace Example)

**Senior team member arrives 12 minutes late**: Boss jokes "So glad you could fit us in." Laughs, explains traffic, moves on. Back to work, focused.

**Junior staffer, same scenario**: Boss makes same joke. But mind doesn't move on:
- Was that snark?
- Were they talking about me before I logged on?
- Do I fit in here?
- Am I any good at this job?

Then evidence keeps "pouring in":
- Inside joke in chat you don't get → "I don't belong"
- Colleague rolls eyes while you're talking → "They don't respect me"
- Boss ignores you → "No one sees me"

By meeting's end, motivation has waned. Then colleague texts "You okay? You seemed out of it." What will you text back?

## "Tifbits": Tiny Fact, Big Theory

The author's term for when small experiences trigger disproportionate existential responses.

**Example**: First-year college student sees crowd around In-N-Out truck. Having never heard of In-N-Out (from Michigan), feels excluded. Bikes away to eat alone, thinking "I'm not standing in line for a burger!"

The ridiculousness is the point: of course not knowing about a burger chain doesn't mean you don't belong in college. But beneath every tifbit is a real question—homesickness, wondering about making friends, feeling far from home.

**Key insight**: Big responses to small experiences reveal what lies beneath the surface. Tifbits are clues to the bigger questions defining our lives.

## Spiraling Up: "Wise" Interventions

The same processes that pull us down can propel us upward. By understanding questions at critical junctures, we can offer better ways to think through challenges.

Examples of documented "wise" interventions:
- 21 minutes improving marriage a year later
- A one-page letter keeping kids out of jail
- Postcards cutting suicide rates by half over two years
- An hour-long belonging reflection in college improving life satisfaction a decade later

**The mechanism**: Early moments where people could go either way. Offer good answers to defining questions at the right time.

## Implications for Team Dynamics

From the article's own framing for leaders:

1. **Small comments have outsized impact on junior members** - The same joke lands differently depending on someone's sense of belonging
2. **Ambiguous social cues get interpreted through the lens of core questions** - What you intend isn't always what's received
3. **Foster inclusive culture** - Create environments where people feel valued before stress triggers spirals
4. **Identify underlying beliefs** - What "core questions" do team members hold about their roles and connections?
5. **Engage about feelings around mundane topics** - Deeper connections prevent misinterpretation of ambiguous cues

## The Alternative View

Some argue resilience is built through adversity—challenging situations strengthen character. But the research suggests: negative spirals aren't inevitable, and proactive measures can transform potential pitfalls into growth opportunities.

The key isn't avoiding all challenges, but having *good answers* to core questions *available* when challenges arise.

## Key Quotes

> "For a tifbit is never just a tiny fact. It's a clue to the bigger questions that define our lives."

> "Negative spirals or feedback loops like these aren't inevitable. In fact, there are small things we can do both for ourselves and for others to nip them in the bud."

> "By understanding the questions that come up at critical junctures, we can offer people better ways to think through challenges—ways that can help them spiral up, instead of down."

## Connection to Leadership Principles

This framework connects to several engineering leadership concepts:

- **Psychological Safety**: Creating environments where core belonging questions are settled enables better work
- **Junior vs Senior Dynamics**: Same events land differently based on tenure and security
- **Feedback and Communication**: Ambiguous signals get interpreted through existing fears
- **Inclusive Culture**: Proactive belonging work prevents reactive spiral-fighting

## Locally Optimal Psychology (Chris Lakin)

*Source: https://chrislakin.blog/p/locally-optimal (via LessWrong) - Added: 2026-01-18*

A complementary framework to the spirals model: chronic psychological issues (depression, self-loathing, poor agency, muscle tension) are often **locally optimal strategies**—not ideal, but the best available option given current constraints.

### The Core Insight

> "Depression certainly wasn't the globally optimal strategy, but given the options, it was a locally optimal strategy."

**The Jake Example**: Jake felt horrible whenever he interacted with people due to emotional insecurities. Without knowing how to outgrow the insecurities, his system had two options:
1. Interact with people → constantly feel horrible
2. Don't interact → "depression"

The system converged on option 2. It's not *good*, but it was the *best known and accessible* strategy at the time.

**Resolution**: Once Jake outgrew his emotional insecurities (the root cause), he was no longer blocked on the better optimum of "interact with others AND not feel horrible." The depression evaporated—two years and counting.

### More Examples of Local Optima

| Presenting Issue | What It's Optimizing For |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Self-loathing | Avoiding conflict with others |
| Lack of agency | Avoiding judgments of failure |
| Chronic neck pain | (Suppressed—harder to identify) |
| Conflict avoidance | Safety from emotional pain |
| Emotional numbness | Protection from overwhelm |

The ideal state combines both: self-love AND safety from conflicts; agency AND being okay with failure judgments. But reaching that global optimum requires first understanding why the current strategy exists.

### The Key Question

> "If there were no downsides to resolving a persistent issue, then why has it lasted so long?"

This reframe is powerful: if the issue could simply be "fixed," it would have been. Its persistence suggests it's serving a purpose—even if that purpose is opaque.

### Why Symptoms Fight Back

> "If my mind had hit the 'undo depression' button while I was depressed, I would've gotten hurt!"

This explains why direct symptom-fighting often fails:
- The symptom exists for a reason
- Removing it without addressing the root cause exposes you to the harm the symptom was preventing
- The system will reassert the symptom to protect itself

Compare to the spirals framework: calcification happens because the behavior makes sense given current beliefs.

### The Neck Pain Case Study

Lakin had chronic neck pain for 3.5 years. Physical therapy and stretching didn't work. Only when he understood "precisely how it was strategic" did he make progress—90% reduction since.

Key observation: "Noticing how my neck pain was locally optimal was quite tricky, and even suppressed."

The body may actively hide the strategic function of symptoms from conscious awareness.

### How Common Are Local Optima?

Lakin's estimate: "When an issue has lasted years, local optimality is more probable than not."

This shifts the default assumption from:
- "Something is wrong with me" → "My system is solving a problem I haven't fully identified"
- "I need more willpower" → "I need to understand what this strategy is protecting me from"
- "This is a defect" → "This is an optimization for the wrong objective"

### Connection to the Spirals Framework

Both frameworks share key insights:
- **Symptoms make sense in context** - Not random malfunctions but purposeful responses
- **Direct fighting backfires** - Working against the symptom without addressing root causes fails
- **Resolution requires understanding** - Step change happens when you see the full picture
- **Persistence is a clue** - Long-lasting issues indicate some form of local optimization

The spirals framework emphasizes the *social* dimension (how others' responses calcify our beliefs) while local optimality emphasizes the *protective* dimension (what the symptom prevents).

### Practical Implications

1. **Ask "what is this protecting me from?"** instead of "how do I stop this?"
2. **Expect resistance** - the system will defend its current optimum
3. **Look for suppression** - the strategic function may be hidden from awareness
4. **Seek the global optimum** - what would it look like to have the benefit without the cost?
5. **Be patient** - understanding the function often takes time

### Key Quote

> "Any persistent mental issue is probably a locally optimal strategy."

This is a strong claim but shifts the frame productively: from pathology to optimization, from defect to protection.

## Catastrophizing as Political Commitment (Matthew Yglesias)

*Source: [Why are young liberals so depressed?](https://www.slowboring.com/p/why-are-young-liberals-so-depressed) - Slow Boring (2023) - Added: 2026-01-18*

A political-cultural lens on the catastrophizing patterns described above. Key insight: progressive institutions have inadvertently trained young people that depressive framing is a sign of political seriousness.

### The Research Finding

The 2021 paper "The politics of depression" (Gimbrone, Bates, Prins, Keyes) found diverging depression trends by **both gender and political ideology**:
- Liberal girls: highest increase in depressive affect
- Conservative boys: lowest increase
- Liberal boys more depressed than conservative girls

This suggests political ideology has an independent effect on mental health, separate from gender or social media dynamics.

### The Catastrophizing Problem

> "Mentally processing ambiguous events with a negative spin is just what depression is."

Yglesias argues that much progressive discourse models exactly the cognitive patterns CBT tries to unlearn:

**The Academic Framing (from the paper)**:
"Throughout this period, war, climate change, school shootings, structural racism, police violence against Black people, pervasive sexism and sexual assault, and rampant socioeconomic inequality became unavoidable features of political discourse."

**The Reframe**:
"Progressive activists and intellectuals have succeeded in getting more people to pay attention to what they think are the most important problems."

Same facts, opposite framing. The first reads like a depressed person's account; the second reads like progress.

### CBT Principles Applied to Political Discourse

From Yglesias's own therapy experience:

1. **Reframe emotional response as under your control**
   - Not: "So-and-so made me angry by doing X"
   - But: "So-and-so did X, and I reacted by becoming angry"
   - Then ask: Did becoming angry make things better?

2. **Depression breeds pessimism about change**
   > "Depressed people are pessimists, so the person who's depressed because of their terrible job will naturally think they could never get another job, or that all jobs would be equally bad."

3. **Dwelling doesn't help**
   > "People who are paralyzed by anxiety or depression or who are lashing out with rage aren't usually totally untethered from reality. They are worried or sad or angry about real things. But instead of changing the things they can change and seeking the grace to accept the things they can't, they're dwelling unproductively as problems fester."

### The Harm Language Trap (Jill Filipovic)

> "People who feel like they are the chief architects of their own life—that they captain their own ship, not that they are simply being tossed around by an uncontrollable ocean—are vastly better off than people whose default position is victimization, hurt, and a sense that life simply happens to them and they have no control over their response."

The problem with "harm" framing:
- Short-term: Gives power in progressive spaces (people take you seriously)
- Long-term: Undermines emotional regulation and resilience
- Creates feedback loop: "Leaning into the language of harm creates and reinforces feelings of harm"

### Connection to Other Frameworks

**Spirals Framework**: Catastrophizing political discourse triggers "tifbits" that activate core questions about belonging and adequacy. If your political identity says "the world is terrible and getting worse," every news item confirms the spiral.

**Local Optimality**: Depressive framing might be locally optimal in progressive social contexts—it signals commitment, seriousness, being "appropriately" affected by injustice. But globally suboptimal for actual wellbeing.

**Selection vs. Causation**: Some effect may be selection (miserable people drawn to progressive politics) but some is likely causal (progressive framing teaches catastrophizing).

### Practical Takeaways

1. **Political beliefs affect mental health** - Not just "objective conditions" but how you're taught to frame them
2. **Catastrophizing is never the answer** - Even when worried about real problems
3. **Agency matters** - Feeling like "chief architect" vs "tossed by ocean" predicts wellbeing
4. **Beware social incentives** - If your community rewards depressive framing, you'll produce more of it
5. **Ambiguity allows choice** - Politics is "a mixed bag that could be looked at in different ways"

### Key Quote

> "I think some of it is poor behavior by adult progressives, many of whom now valorize depressive affect as a sign of political commitment. The thing about depression, though, is that it's bad."

## The De-Bog Framework: A Taxonomy of Stuckness (Adam Mastroianni)

*Source: [So you wanna de-bog yourself](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/so-you-wanna-de-bog-yourself) - Experimental History (2024) - Added: 2026-01-18*

A practical catalog of patterns that keep people stuck, organized into three categories. The core insight: naming the pattern is often the first step to escaping it.

### Category 1: Insufficient Activation Energy

These patterns look like doing nothing—standing motionless, unable to muster the effort to escape.

#### Gutterballing
Excelling in slightly the wrong direction. Taking on projects for others' approval rather than genuine interest, then feeling resentful. Like a bowling ball that gets closer to pins for most of its journey but dramatically misses at the end.

> "Gutterballing is a guaranteed way to stay stuck in the bog because people will love you for it."

#### Waiting for Jackpot
Refusing to act until an option appears that dominates all others on all dimensions. Often disguised as: "I'd like a solution that involves me doing everything 100% exactly like I'm doing it right now, and getting better outcomes."

#### Declining the Dragon
Knowing exactly what needs to be done but being too afraid to do it. The insight: being brave *feels good*. When you chicken out, you don't just feel cowardice—you miss out on the pleasure of courage.

> "Medieval knights used to wander around hoping for honorable adventures to pop up so that they could demonstrate their bravery... When I put off doing the brave thing, I am declining the dragon."

#### The Mediocrity Trap
Situations bad-but-not-too-bad that keep you forever in their orbit because they never inspire the frustration needed for escape velocity. Terrible situations become funny stories; mediocre situations become Lost Years.

#### Stroking the Problem
Obsessively examining a problem without actually solving it. "Oh boy, what a problem! A real whopper, I'd say. Massive, even. Get a load of this problem!" A form of socially acceptable anxiety.

### Category 2: Bad Escape Plans

You've got the activation energy but aim it wrong.

#### The "Try Harder" Fallacy
Believing you'll improve by wishing things different. "I've been doing all of this very diligent desiring for things to be different, and yet they remain the same."

#### The Infinite Effort Illusion
Imagining you have a secret unused stock of effort to deploy in the future. "No problem, I'll simply uncork my Strategic Effort Reserve." There is no reserve—all effort is currently accounted for.

#### Blaming God
Ruminating on how unfair it is that unchangeable things are what they are. "If there were only 25 hours in the day!" No deity responds to whining.

#### Diploma vs Toothbrushing Problems
**Diploma problems**: Work at it, then done forever (riding a bike).
**Toothbrushing problems**: Work at them forever until you die.

Most feeling-stuck problems are toothbrushing problems misidentified as diploma problems.

#### Fantastical Metamorphosis
"I'll just be a different person in the future." I hate working out, but future-me will overcome this by not being such a baby. So far, no one has woken up different in all the ways that would make life easier.

#### Puppeteering
Trying to solve your problems by controlling others' actions. Attractive because others' actions seem silly and therefore changeable—but they feel the same way about you.

### Category 3: Self-Bogging (Imaginary Bogs)

The hardest to escape because they require realizing your perception isn't reality.

#### Floor is Lava
Making up a game and deciding you're losing at it. "I have to be as successful as my most successful friend, but everything I've done so far doesn't count." Did you create these rules by thinking hard about how to live well? No—you pulled them out of your butt.

#### Super Surveillance
Tracking every problem in the world as if they were all your problems. Spending time looking at screens and feeling bad doesn't solve the monitored problems.

> "The most saintly life possible is one spent sitting in front of a hundred screens, eyelids held open with surgical instruments, A Clockwork Orange-style, bearing witness to all human suffering simultaneously."

#### Hedgehogging
Refusing to be influenced by others, even when you should. Classic symptom: feeling existential despair, being told "you're hungry," denying it, eating a burrito, feeling fine.

#### Personal Problems Growth Ray
Your problems are 50-foot-tall moody teenagers. Other people's problems are tiny silly things walking around like they're real.

> "Such is the result of the personal problems growth ray, which makes all of your own problems seem larger than life, while other people's stay actual size."

#### Obsessing Over Tiny Predictors
Spending 45 minutes debating whether to bold your name on your CV. Easier to optimize insignificant decisions than admit you can't control the future.

#### Impossible Satisfaction
Believing satisfaction is fundamentally impossible. Standing in a kitchen full of ingredients and an oven, saying "I can't make a cake! Cakes don't even exist!"

### The Meta-Insight

The biggest bog lie: that you're stuck in a situation unlike any you or anyone else has ever seen before. If you believe that, nothing you've learned can help you.

Naming the pattern is the escape hatch:

> "Whenever I feel that way, whenever I think I'm in a bespoke bog, created just for me by a universe that hates me, if I can think to myself, 'Oh, I'm gutterballing right now,' I can feel my foot hit solid ground."

### Connection to Other Frameworks

**Spirals Framework**: De-bog patterns describe the *mechanics* of getting stuck; spirals describe the *social reinforcement* that calcifies stuckness.

**Local Optimality**: Many bog patterns are locally optimal strategies—gutterballing earns approval, super surveillance signals virtue, hedgehogging avoids vulnerability. They persist because they're solving a problem you haven't identified.

**CBT Connection**: "Floor is lava" and "personal problems growth ray" are essentially cognitive distortions with better names.
