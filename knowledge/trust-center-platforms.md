# Trust Center Platforms

A Trust Center is a centralized, self-serve portal that gives customers, partners, and prospects access to your security posture, certifications, and policies.

## Why Trust Centers Matter

- **Competitive advantage** - Security transparency is expected, not optional
- **Accelerate deals** - Customers can self-serve security reviews instead of back-and-forth
- **Build credibility** - Demonstrates commitment to security in a market where data breaches are common
- **Internal culture** - Promotes security awareness across the team

## Trade-offs to Consider

- Maintaining a Trust Center requires ongoing effort that could divert from core development
- Some customers may prioritize other aspects over security transparency
- Need to keep certifications and policies current
