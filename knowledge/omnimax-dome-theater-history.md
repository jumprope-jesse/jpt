# Omnimax Dome Theater History

Source: [J.B. Crawford's computer.rip](https://computer.rip/2025-06-08-Omnimax.html)

## Overview

Omnimax was a dome projection format developed for planetarium-style theaters, using 70mm film with spherical fisheye lenses to project images across a near-hemisphere screen. It evolved from traditional planetarium technology and became the pinnacle of science museum film exhibition before digital projection made it obsolete.

## Key Timeline

- **1923**: Zeiss planetarium projector introduced, establishing the dome theater tradition
- **1970**: IMAX debuts at Expo Osaka - 15-perf sideways 70mm format
- **1973**: First tilted planetarium at Fleet Science Center (San Diego) - 25-degree dome tilt
- **1973**: First Omnimax installation at Fleet, combining IMAX film transport with spherical fisheye lens
- **1978-79**: Rapid expansion to science museums (Detroit, Minnesota, Pittsburgh)
- **1979**: First commercial Omnimax at Caesars Palace Las Vegas (closed 2000)
- **1992**: OMSI Portland opens 330-seat Omnimax theater
- **2000s**: Digital transition begins, IMAX abandons Omnimax name
- **2013**: OMSI closes its Omnimax, replaces with generic digital theater
- **Present**: ~10 IMAX Dome laser projectors exist; few original film projectors remain operational

## Technical Specifications

### Projection Equipment
- Projector weight: ~2 tons
- Cost: ~$2 million (1992)
- Lamp: 15 kW water-cooled, replaced every 800-1,000 hours
- Film: 70mm, 15-perf sideways format
- Rule of thumb: 1 mile of film = 8.5 minutes of runtime

### Theater Design
- Projection room: positive-pressure cleanroom to protect prints
- Screen: perforated aluminum (speakers behind)
- Screen size: up to 10,000 sq ft dome
- Seating: tilted 25-45 degrees facing dome center

### Audio System
- 6-channel: left rear, left screen, center screen, right screen, right rear, top
- Each channel with independent bass cabinet
- Sub-bass array at screen bottom
- Audio distributed on magnetic tape (8-track) then CDs (3 discs, 2 channels each)
- Show control descended from original PDP-15 at Fleet

## Key Players

### Companies
- **IMAX Corporation**: Developed the film format and projection systems
- **Graphic Films Corporation**: Founded by Lester Novros (Disney animator), closely tied to IMAX, created "the wormhole" vanity card
- **MacGillivray Freeman Films**: Started making skateboard/surf films, became dominant in IMAX documentaries, filmed "To Fly!"

### Notable Films
- **"Voyage to the Outer Planets"** (1973): First Omnimax film, 10 minutes, produced by Graphic Films
- **"To Fly!"** (1976): 27-minute aviation documentary, premiered at National Air and Space Museum, ran everywhere
- **"Ring of Fire"** (volcano documentary): OMSI premiere film, funded by museum consortium

### Filming Challenges
- IMAX cameras: 80+ pounds, expensive, limited takes
- Space filming: 1,000+ pound cameras, astronauts trained as operators
- Underwater filming: custom housings for deep sea

## Decline Factors

1. **High filming costs**: Made new documentary production impractical
2. **Limited commercial viability**: Content constrained to educational documentaries
3. **Digital transition**: IMAX abandoned film format, digital dome projectors slow to match quality
4. **Maintenance costs**: Specialized equipment, end of vendor support

## Preservation Challenges

- Few photographs or videos of theaters/presentations exist
- The dome experience cannot be reproduced on flat screens
- Films distributed only to science museums, poorly documented
- Original projectors becoming impossible to maintain

## Modern Successors

- **MSG Sphere (Las Vegas)**: LED dome display, no projection
- **IMAX Dome laser projectors**: Only 10 exist globally
- **Sony dome systems**: Replaced some original installations
- Fleet Science Center preserved original projector, still runs reprisals

## Connection to World's Fairs

Niche film formats historically debuted at Expos/World's Fairs:
- IMAX at Expo Osaka 1970
- Cinerama 360 at 1964 New York World's Fair ("To the Moon and Beyond")
- Circle-Vision 360 (survives at EPCOT)

Many exhibition formats couldn't transition to conventional theaters, remaining tied to special venues.

## Quotable Insight

> "There was once a parallel theater industry, a world with none of the glamor of Hollywood but for whom James Cameron hauled a camera to the depths of the ocean and Leonardo DiCaprio narrated repairs to the Hubble."
