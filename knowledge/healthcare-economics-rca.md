# Healthcare Economics: Challenging Conventional Wisdom

*Source: Random Critical Analysis - https://randomcriticalanalysis.com/why-conventional-wisdom-on-health-care-is-wrong-a-primer/*

Comprehensive data-driven analysis arguing that US healthcare spending is explained by income levels, not "high prices" or system dysfunction.

## Core Thesis

Health spending is overwhelmingly determined by average real income. The income elasticity is ~1.8 (1% income increase → 1.8% health spending increase). The US is not an outlier when using proper household income measures rather than GDP.

## Key Arguments

### 1. Income Drives Spending (Not Prices)

- Using Actual Individual Consumption (AIC) instead of GDP, US spending fits the international trend
- GDP is a weaker predictor than household-perspective measures
- Changes in income precede changes in health spending by 3-4 years (rules out reverse causation)

### 2. Prices Are NOT Rising Faster Than Income

BEA's PCE health care price index and CMS's PHC price index show health prices have increased *less* than GDP per capita. The widely-cited BLS CPI indexes are unreliable for this purpose.

> "The rising health share cannot be explained as primarily a price-driven phenomenon"

### 3. America Consumes More (Not Pays More Per Unit)

The real difference: quantity of healthcare consumed, not price per unit.

- Health worker density rises sharply with income
- US health employment has increased ~6x since 1950
- "All of our extra health workers must be doing something and they sure as hell demand to get paid"

### 4. The "It's the Prices, Stupid" Paper Was Wrong

The famous Anderson et al. claim is contradicted by:
- Reliable OECD price benchmarks (rarely cited)
- Input data showing US employs far more health workers
- IFHP price data (widely cited) has serious methodological problems

### 5. Physician Pay Doesn't Explain Much

- Physicians are ~5% of health workforce
- Their relative pay hasn't increased significantly since 1990
- US physician multiples (vs. average worker) are within 20-30% of other OECD countries
- High physician pay is offset by lower pay elsewhere in the system

### 6. Rising Costs = Rising Intensity (Technology)

The increase in cost-per-encounter is NOT price inflation - it's intensity:
- More diagnostics, procedures, and treatments per visit
- Adoption of cutting-edge technology (transplants, pacemakers, ICDs, imaging)
- Income elasticity for novel medical technology is often 1.5-3x

### 7. "Utilization" Metrics Don't Show What People Think

Office visits, hospital discharges, bed-days - none correlate strongly with health spending. The US is not systematically "low" on these metrics relative to spending. The real volume comes from intensity per encounter, not encounter frequency.

### 8. Diminishing Returns Explain US Health Outcomes

Why US life expectancy is mediocre despite high spending:
- **Diminishing returns**: Norway/Luxembourg spend 2x Spain/Italy with worse outcomes
- **Lifestyle factors**: Obesity (explains ~50% of gap), car accidents, homicides, drug overdoses
- **Not the healthcare system**: Removing external causes and obesity largely eliminates the gap

## Implications

1. **No free lunch**: You can't dramatically cut spending without cutting real healthcare delivery
2. **Productivity dividend**: Rising productivity in other sectors (food, goods) funds the growing health share
3. **Sustainability**: Current trends are sustainable - potential consumption rises across all categories even as health share grows
4. **Policy misdirection**: Efforts focused on "lowering prices" miss the actual driver (quantity/intensity demanded)

## Methodological Notes

- Uses log-log plots throughout (slopes = elasticity, interpretable as % changes)
- Relies on OECD health PPP benchmarks for prices (most methodologically rigorous)
- Cross-sectional and time-series evidence both support the income-driven model
- Extensive citations to primary sources (linked in original)

## Key Takeaway

> "America is distinguished primarily by the sheer quantity of resources it puts into healthcare."

The US healthcare debate is largely misdirected because it assumes high prices/profits explain costs. The evidence suggests Americans simply demand and receive more healthcare as a natural consequence of higher incomes.
