# Apple's Position in the AI Era

## Ben Thompson's "Apple on the Periphery" Thesis (Sep 2025)

From Stratechery, September 2025:

**Key Observation:** iPhone launches used to capture the attention of the entire industry, but the iPhone 17 launch had minimal buzz. Those who watched were unimpressed, despite Thompson arguing the new iPhones are "really good, and a big jump forward."

**The Disconnect:** The reason people are disappointed isn't the product quality - it's that Apple's willing abdication of entire product categories speaks much larger than their continued excellence in past paradigms.

As the industry focuses on AI, Apple's traditional product excellence matters less. They're optimizing for the previous era while the industry moves on.

## Implications

- Brand loyalty may matter less when the competitive landscape shifts to new paradigms
- Excellence in legacy categories doesn't guarantee relevance in emerging ones
- The "periphery" position isn't about product quality but strategic positioning

Same week: Atlassian acquired The Browser Company to build an "AI-enabled browser for work." Thompson was skeptical that browsers are the future, but the acquisition signals where enterprise attention is focused.
