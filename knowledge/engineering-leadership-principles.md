## Key Principles

### Communicate the "Why"
Always communicate the "why" behind decisions. Context and rationale help teams understand and buy into choices.

### Trust and Verify
Trust your team but verify outcomes. Balance autonomy with accountability.

### Technical Debt as Business Decision
Technical debt is a business decision, not just a tech one. Frame tech debt discussions in terms of business impact, velocity, and risk.

## Communicating with Executives (Translation Layer)

### How Executives Think

1. **Your boss has a boss** - CEOs answer to boards, shareholders, customers, and sometimes regulators. Understand the drivers for your company.

2. **Execs are short on time** - Not busier than you, but their span of responsibility is wider, so proportionally less time per topic. Make your time with them count.

3. **Execs optimize for company-wide impact** - They weigh how proposals affect customers, other teams, and financials across the company, not just engineering.

4. **Execs will have questions** - Anticipate and answer these upfront:
   - How much will it cost?
   - What will I get for the money?
   - What other options have you considered?
   - Why now, and what happens if we don't do it?
   - How will success be measured, and on what timeline?
   - What are the key risks, and how do we mitigate them?
   - Who owns delivery, and how confident are we in execution?
   - How might this affect other areas of the business?

### The Translation Layer

- **Speak business, not engineering** - Terms like API, CI/CD, latency, blue-green deployment don't translate. Use language tied to business outcomes.
- **Time horizons differ** - Engineering goals are days/weeks/months. Exec goals (EBITDA, CAC, brand reputation) are years. Map your work up to those longer horizons.
- **Engineering is expensive** - Often one of the largest company investments. Execs will scrutinize tech investments closely.
- **Make proposals about the business** - Not about improving engineering for its own purposes.

### Useful Question to Ask Execs

> "What would you say are the two or three forces or stakeholders that most shape our company's direction right now?"

Shows strategic curiosity and provides useful context for future proposals.
