## Key Principles

### Communicate the "Why"
Always communicate the "why" behind decisions. Context and rationale help teams understand and buy into choices.

### Trust and Verify
Trust your team but verify outcomes. Balance autonomy with accountability.

### Technical Debt as Business Decision
Technical debt is a business decision, not just a tech one. Frame tech debt discussions in terms of business impact, velocity, and risk.
