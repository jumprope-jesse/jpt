# Higher-Order Evidence and Conspiracy Thinking

Why conspiracy theorists aren't ignorant rubes - they're *epistemology* rubes. The failure mode is accepting improbable theories and neglecting higher-order evidence, not lacking facts.

## The Core Insight

**"I probably know less about science than most people who think the earth is flat do."**

Most people who correctly believe the earth is round know fewer specific facts about proving it than flat-earthers do. The flat-earther has *studied* the topic obsessively. They have arguments, data points, apparent anomalies. In a debate about the specific evidence, they'd likely crush an average person.

**The difference isn't knowledge - it's epistemology.**

## What Higher-Order Evidence Is

Higher-order evidence = evidence about the reliability of evidence-generating processes, not about the object-level claim itself.

**Example:** Why reject the claim that there are "two different kinds of eclipses that only make sense if the earth is flat"?

- **Not because** you have specialized knowledge about eclipses
- **But because** you accept, based on higher-order evidence, that there's not some deep hole in our understanding of eclipses that has eluded all top science journals

The higher-order evidence: "If this were true, credible experts would have noticed."

## The Conspiracy Theorist's Epistemological Failures

### 1. Accepting Improbable Theories

The flat-earther thinks it's more probable that:
- A global conspiracy with thousands of actors exists
- This conspiracy has somehow been detected by disproportionately scientifically illiterate internet sleuths
- All experts are either lying or fooled

...than that there's some explanation they don't understand for apparently strange features of water.

**This is a prior probability failure.** The base rate of "global conspiracies covering up basic physics, discovered by YouTube researchers" is essentially zero.

### 2. Neglecting Higher-Order Evidence

Conspiracy theorists argue entirely on object-level details while ignoring:
- Why would thousands of people maintain this secret?
- What's the probability experts are all wrong vs. you being confused?
- What historical track record do theories like this have?

### 3. Confusing Knowledge with Reasoning

Having memorized lots of facts and arguments ≠ good reasoning. You can know more about a topic than anyone else and still be catastrophically wrong about it if your inference patterns are broken.

## Why It's Hard to Argue with Conspiracy Theorists

**They probably know more about the subject than you do.**

- They've spent years on it
- They've prepared arguments for common objections
- They can throw out obscure facts you can't verify on the fly

**And it's hard to argue from higher-order evidence in a debate:**
- "The experts disagree with you" sounds like appeal to authority
- "That's improbable" sounds dismissive
- The debate format rewards whoever has more detailed object-level claims ready

### The Tom Jump vs. Ryan Dawson Example

YouTuber Tom Jump debated Ryan Dawson (who believes Israeli and U.S. governments were involved in 9/11). Jump went in with no prep, thinking the facts were on his side.

**He got crushed.**

Not because Dawson was right - but because Dawson had spent 20 years obsessing over every detail, and Jump hadn't appreciated how hard it is to argue with a conspiracy theorist on the object level.

## Why Most People Reject Conspiracy Theories (For the Wrong Reason)

**Most people reject conspiracy theories because they are conformists** - they just believe things that sound normal.

This is actually a decent heuristic! If smart people mostly think your belief is crazy, it probably is.

**But:** It's a huge mistake to think you've identified the specific object-level reasons the conspiracy theory is wrong. You probably haven't. You're trusting the process.

### The Danger of the Smug

Thinking "conspiracy theorists just don't know basic facts" leads to:

1. **Overconfidence** - believing you'd never fall for one
2. **Getting trapped** - when you encounter a conspiracy theory in a domain where your conformist heuristics don't apply
3. **Getting destroyed in debates** - when you actually try to argue object-level with someone who's prepared
4. **Smugness** - feeling superior for reasons you can't actually articulate

Scott Alexander's confession: "When I was a teenager I believed in a conspiracy theory" (Graham Hancock's Atlantis theory). The reason he now rejects it isn't specialized knowledge about ancient history - it's that he estimates the probability of *some* mundane explanation as high, even if he doesn't know what it is.

## The Right Epistemic Moves

### 1. Reason from Higher-Order Evidence

"It's likelier that you are wrong than that all the experts are" is a valid argument, even if it feels unsatisfying.

### 2. Appreciate the Difficulty

Object-level debate with a prepared conspiracy theorist requires either:
- Years of subject-matter expertise yourself
- Or accepting you'll lose the debate even while being right

### 3. Don't Confuse Conformity with Understanding

You're probably right to believe consensus views. But knowing *why* requires more than "I can Google things."

### 4. Recognize the Asymmetry

Generating plausible-sounding alternative explanations is easy. Verifying them is hard. The conspiracy theorist has infinite time to generate objections; you don't have infinite time to research every one.

## Practical Applications

### When Hiring/Collaborating

**Warning sign:** Someone who's obviously intelligent, has impressive knowledge, but reaches weird conclusions. The failure isn't IQ or information - it's epistemological machinery.

### When Evaluating Arguments

Ask: "Am I being asked to engage on object-level details I can't verify, while ignoring higher-order evidence about priors and expert consensus?"

### When You Encounter a Compelling Conspiracy Theory

Before diving into the details, ask:
1. What's the base rate of theories like this being true?
2. If this were true, who would have noticed, and why hasn't it been noticed?
3. Am I being asked to ignore higher-order evidence?

### When Debating

Don't debate a 20-year obsessive on object-level details you haven't studied. Either:
- Prepare extensively
- Argue from higher-order evidence and accept it'll feel unsatisfying
- Decline the debate
