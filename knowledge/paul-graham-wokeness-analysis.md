## Core Thesis

Wokeness is an instance of an ancient phenomenon: priggishness. Every society has people attracted to shallow, exacting moral purity who demonstrate virtue by attacking rule-breakers. Only the rules change (Victorian Christianity, Stalinist Marxism, social justice). The question is not "why do prigs exist?" but "why these rules, at this moment?"

## Definition

> **Political correctness / wokeness**: An aggressively performative focus on social justice.

The problem is the performativeness, not the social justice. Racism is a genuine problem - but the politically correct focused on punishing wrong words rather than actually helping marginalized groups.

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Political Correctness (late 1980s - late 1990s)

**Trigger**: 1960s radicals finished dissertations and got tenure in the early 1970s. By late 1980s, they had accumulated power.

**Why humanities/social sciences**: More scope for injecting politics (vs. physics). Also larger, easier undergrad majors.

**Characteristics**:
- Faculty encouraging students to attack other faculty (like Cultural Revolution)
- Expansion of "hostile environment" from explicit advances to making someone "feel uncomfortable"
- Three main accusations: sexism, racism, homophobia
- Elaborate, frequently-changing rules became substitute for actual virtue

**Key insight**: Complex orthodoxy works as virtue substitute because it's *difficult*. The shallow, frequently-changing rules allowed bad people to seem more virtuous than good people who weren't up on current fashions.

**Contributing factors**:
- Prigs starved of other rules (religion/sex dead among cultural elite)
- Fall of Soviet Union (1989) left Marxism-focused left seeking new focus

**Died down**: Late 1990s, largely because humor. "Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against priggishness."

### Phase 2: Cancel Culture / Wokeness (early 2010s - peak 2020-2021)

**Triggers**:
- Social media (especially Tumblr, Twitter) - users seek outrage, want to share it
- Group chat apps enabled mob formation
- Polarization of press (papers abandoned neutrality post-print)
- Cheap "loop journalism": controversial tweet → story → outraged shares → more stories
- New professional class of enforcers ("inclusion" in job titles, DEI bureaucrats)
- BLM (2013), Me Too (2017), Trump election (2016), George Floyd (2020)

**Differences from Phase 1**:
- More virulent
- Spread beyond universities
- Wider variety of sins (many new -isms and -phobias invented)
- Professional enforcers with jobs depending on finding problems
- Cancel mobs on social media

**DEI hiring**: Particularly dangerous - bureaucrats involved in hiring tried to ensure only people sharing their beliefs got hired. DEI statements as initial filter for faculty candidates.

## Viral Dynamics

The "mind-virus" mechanism:

1. Zealots invent new impropriety
2. Fellow zealots adopt it (virtue signaling)
3. Larger group adopts from fear (avoiding trouble)
4. New impropriety established
5. Rate of rule change increases
6. Increased anxiety about unknown rules
7. Cycle accelerates

Organizations especially vulnerable - they do everything by "best practices" and can't delay when told they might be committing improprieties right now.

## Signs of Retreat (post-2020)

- Corporate CEOs rejecting it (Brian Armstrong)
- Universities reaffirming free speech (UChicago, MIT)
- Elon Musk buying Twitter, neutralizing it without censorship
- Consumer rejection (Bud Light brand damage)
- Trump's 2024 victory (partially)

## Proposed Solutions

### For Wokeness Specifically

**Treat it like a religion** - wokeness is effectively a religion with God replaced by protected classes. Use existing customs for religion in organizations:
- Express beliefs but don't call coworkers infidels
- Can't ban speech contradicting doctrines
- No DEI statements (we wouldn't require proof of religious beliefs)
- No indoctrination sessions with compliance verification

Test: "Would we do this if it were Christianity?"

Don't reject everything woke (that's zealotry too) - just don't let it be normative.

### For Future Outbreaks

**Bias against new heresies**: The aggressively conventional-minded always give themselves away by defining new heresies. Default assumption should be that banning previously-allowed speech is wrong. Burden of proof on those claiming "harm."

> "The number of true things we can't say should not increase. If it does, something is wrong."

## Notable Observations

**On nomenclature evolution**: Religious observances must be inconvenient and slightly absurd, otherwise gentiles would do it too. Hence "slaves" → "enslaved individuals" → edge cases like "individuals experiencing slavery."

**On women as enforcers**: More common (Orwell noted this). Also, sexual harassment expansion ("hostile environment") created ambiguity that expanded to ideas making people uncomfortable.

**On Larry Summers**: Pushed out for mentioning Darwin's greater male variability hypothesis. The test: "If truth should prevail anywhere, it should be in universities."

**On humor**: "Humor is one of the most powerful weapons against priggishness... prigs, being humorless, can't respond in kind."

**On DEI bureaucrats**: "If you hire people to keep watch for a particular type of problem, they're going to find it, because otherwise there's no justification for their existence."

## Key Insight: Orthodoxy as Virtue Substitute

> "Whenever a society has a concept of heresy and orthodoxy, orthodoxy becomes a substitute for virtue. You can be the worst person in the world, but as long as you're orthodox you're better than everyone who isn't. This makes orthodoxy very attractive to bad people."

This explains why elaborate, shifting rules are a feature not a bug - simple rules wouldn't work as virtue substitute.
