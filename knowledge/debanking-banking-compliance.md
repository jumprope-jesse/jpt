## What Debanking Actually Is

"Debanking" describes involuntarily closing a customer's bank account, often without presenting a reason. Industry terms: offboarding, derisking, closing accounts.

Key distinction: Being debanked (account closed) vs being declined (not opened) - very different impacts.

## Why Most Debanking Happens

The vast majority of account closures are for:
- **Credit risk**: Overdraft your account repeatedly, can't pay fees
- **Operational cost**: Aging customers who may lash out at CS, repeated scam victims
- **Risk tolerance mismatch**: Activities outside bank's built-out capabilities
- **AML concerns**: Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed on account

Most people who get debanked simply open a new account elsewhere.

## AML-Driven Debanking

Banks have written AML policies identifying high-risk activities. They must follow these policies. Common high-risk categories:
- Money Services Businesses (MSBs) - includes bodegas selling money orders
- Crypto businesses
- Debt collectors
- Payday lenders

**SAR Confidentiality**: Disclosing the existence of a Suspicious Activity Report is illegal (12 CFR 21.11(k)). Banks cannot tell customers a SAR was filed on them. This creates Kafkaesque situations where the bank "doesn't know" why it closed your account.

Banks file ~4 million SARs per year. About 10% are "Transaction With No Apparent Economic, Business, or Lawful Purpose."

## Why Banks Won't Explain Debanking

1. Legal prohibition on disclosing SARs
2. Liability concerns
3. The typical recipient can't meaningfully participate in the discussion
4. Offboarding letters are "ritual objects" not meant to be taken literally
5. Banks intentionally blind themselves - call center reps don't know the real reason

## Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)

Banks can bank high-risk industries IF they build out EDD programs. Many don't because:
- Expensive to run
- Low revenue from many high-risk customers (bodegas, small businesses)
- Concentration risk

## Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)

PEP = national-level senior official, typically foreign. Does NOT include U.S. public officials.

PEP status attaches to close family and associates. Banks can bank PEPs with appropriate EDD - private banking actively courts them.

## Operation Choke Point (Original)

Obama-era program targeting "odious" industries through banking pressure:
- DOJ used FIRREA "self-affecting" legal theory
- FDIC pushed "reputational risk" concerns
- Targeted: debt collectors, payday lenders, gun sellers, and 30+ industries

Was criticized as lawless and extraprocedural. Regulators denied it while internal emails showed it was intentional policy.

## Silvergate and Crypto Banking

Silvergate was "First National Bank of Crypto" with the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) - 24/7 book transfers between crypto companies.

Why Silvergate failed:
- Transaction monitoring was off for 15 months (trillion dollars unmonitored)
- Onboarded Binance shells despite obvious red flags
- FTX/Alameda was largest client, monitoring was "grossly inadequate"
- Post-FTX, deposits fled, balance sheet issues from rate hikes

The 15% crypto concentration limit: Regulators can and do set concentration limits. This is normal prudential regulation, not conspiracy.

## The "Current Thing" Phenomenon

Monoculture + implied policy direction = coordinated action without explicit orders.

Compliance officers don't need explicit direction - they read the NYT, follow industry consensus, are PMC members who respond to social signals.

The Current Thing is more dangerous than formal guidance because:
- No paper trail
- Moves faster than policy
- Affects individual decisions before anyone can intervene
- Later, no one can find the conspiracy because there wasn't one

## Countermeasures to Debanking

Most effective approach: Create procedural barriers to account closure
- Require documentation like eviction proceedings
- Delay mechanisms
- Appeal processes

Tradeoff: Banks will be more reluctant to open accounts for marginal prospects.

## What Crypto Actually Wants

1. All banks directed to bank "legal businesses" (crypto)
2. New SEN-equivalent for instantaneous settlements
3. Full repudiation of "crypto is high-risk" guidance
4. Banks able to custody crypto assets
5. Fed master accounts for state-chartered crypto companies
6. SEC path to sell tokens to retail
7. Example made of at least one regulator (CFPB?)

## Key Insights

- Debanking isn't mainly political - it's usually credit/operational
- When it IS political, the mechanism is often "Current Thing" not explicit orders
- Canada's Freedom Convoy showed explicit political debanking can happen
- The U.S. does not routinely debank Republicans (test: do you pay in cash?)
- Trust and Safety teams at tech companies were a preview of Compliance risk
- Banks are capital allocators, not utilities - they make risk decisions
