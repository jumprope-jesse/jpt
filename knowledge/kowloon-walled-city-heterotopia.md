## Overview

Scholarly analysis of Kowloon Walled City through three lenses: historical, spatial (Foucault's Heterotopia), and cultural (Ackbar Abbas's "Culture of Disappearance"). Challenges the reductive view of KWC as merely "a problem left over from history."

## Historical Context

- Born from Opium Wars and Unequal Treaties - Hong Kong ceded to Britain, KWC became Chinese enclave
- British invasion in 1899 created political ambiguity - diplomatic "black hole"
- Attracted waves of Chinese refugees: 1920s Nationalist uncertainty, post-WWII civil war, 1950s-70s communist reforms
- Neither Britain nor China wanted full control - served political purposes for both:
  - For China: Visual reminder of Unequal Treaties' illegitimacy
  - For Britain: Contrast between "lawlessness" and colonial "order"
- 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration ended ambiguity - demolished by 1993

## Foucault's Heterotopia Applied

Heterotopia = "spaces of otherness" that exist outside all places while relating to all other sites.

**KWC as Heterotopia of Crisis**: Provided stable refuge for those alienated by China but inconsistent with colonial order. Attracted skilled migrants (doctors, dentists operating without costly licenses) and manufacturing (low regulation overhead).

**Change in Function**: Pre-1950s, just another squatter settlement in accepted unofficial housing policy. Hong Kong's massive public housing program (45% of population by 1980s) shifted KWC from accepted to incongruent.

**Space of Illusion**: Fulfilled suppressed demands - prostitution, drugs, gambling, dog meat restaurants. Clients came from across Hong Kong. The "Dark Twin" providing shadow economy for needs formal economy couldn't meet. Hong Kong's "perfect" image required KWC to represent everything administration stood against.

## Culture of Disappearance (Ackbar Abbas)

- Hong Kong lacked national identity due to colonial suppression of political expression
- Identity directed toward economic realm (individual market participation vs. collective citizenship)
- 1984 declaration triggered intense interest in Hong Kong culture - appearance stimulated by threat of disappearance
- "Reverse hallucination" - not seeing what's actually there, grasping readily available (often colonial-constructed) images
- KWC's negative colonial image was the only "consistent and readily graspable" identity in this cultural landscape

## Key Insight

The Walled City was porous, not isolated. It affected Hong Kong as much as Hong Kong affected it. The "lawless" image was selectively maintained by colonial government through neglecting physical infrastructure while providing soft services (postal, vaccinations, welfare) - keeping the appearance while controlling the narrative.

## Relevance

- Urban planning and informal settlements
- Foucault's spatial theory in practice
- Colonial politics of space and image
- Heritage, memory, and demolition politics
- Shadow economies and their relationship to formal systems

## Photography

Greg Girard's book "City of Darkness: Life in Kowloon Walled City" (1993) documents the settlement before demolition.
