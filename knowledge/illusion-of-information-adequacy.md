# Illusion of Information Adequacy

A cognitive bias identified by researchers at Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and Ohio State (2024). People assume that whatever information they have is sufficient to understand a situation, without pausing to consider what they might be missing.

## The Core Bias

People rarely stop to think about what information they *don't* have. They assume their current knowledge represents an adequate cross-section of reality. This leads to:
- Overconfidence in judgments and decisions
- Less humility than warranted
- Assuming others with different views must be uninformed or irrational

## Key Research Findings

Study with 1,261 participants presented a school merger scenario:
- Group A read only arguments FOR merging
- Group B read only arguments AGAINST merging
- Control group read ALL arguments

Results:
1. **Participants with partial info assumed they had adequate information** to make a good decision
2. **Decisions were heavily influenced by which subset of info they received**
3. **Participants believed most others would decide the same way they did**
4. **Even after seeing all arguments, some clung to their original position** - once formed, opinions are hard to change

## Connection to Naive Realism

Complements the bias of "naive realism" - the assumption that our subjective view represents objective truth. The illusion of information adequacy explains *why* we're so confident: we believe we have all the relevant facts.

## Everyday Example

A driver honks at the car ahead for not moving when the light turns green. The honking driver assumes they understand the situation completely. They don't see the pedestrian the other driver is waiting for.

This pattern appears constantly in:
- Political disagreements
- Workplace conflicts
- Relationship misunderstandings
- Social media debates

## Implications

Given polarized media ecosystems, people are regularly exposed to unrepresentative cross-sections of information. Combined with cognitive efficiency motives (not wanting to expend extra effort), most people don't naturally consider:
- What information might be missing
- How representative their information sample is
- Whether others have different information that explains their position

## Counteracting the Bias

- **Pause before judging**: Ask "What might I not know here?"
- **Assume good faith**: Others may have information you don't
- **Seek out opposing views**: Actively look for what's missing from your picture
- **Hold positions loosely**: Especially on complex issues with partial information
