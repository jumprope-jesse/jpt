# Altruism as a Virtue

Philosophical analysis of altruism—not as "effective altruism" (how to do it efficiently) but as a virtue: Should we be altruistic? How can we practice it well? How do we become genuinely altruistic?

## Definition and Scope

**Altruism**: Acting with the motivation of promoting someone else's welfare, even at cost to yourself.

Key distinctions:
- Requires *action* (distinguishes from passive emotions like sympathy)
- Requires explicit *motivation* to promote welfare (distinguishes from justice or duty)
- Allows self-interested motives to coexist—doesn't require pure self-sacrifice
- Neutral about whom to benefit (unlike some definitions that require impartiality)

**Egoism**: Always doing what's expected to benefit your own welfare. Egoists may still act kindly—but only when beneficial to themselves.

**Maximalist altruism**: Always promote others' welfare as much as possible, considering your own well-being only insofar as it enables further service.

Most people occupy the middle ground.

## The Central Paradox

How can altruism be a virtue if it means self-sacrifice? Two problems:

1. If altruism means deprioritizing your welfare, how can it promote your flourishing?
2. If altruism benefits the altruist, isn't it just egoism with extra steps?

### The "Everything Is Egoism" Response

The cynical assumption fails as a blanket explanation. Altruistic motivation is *unexceptional* in humans. And that altruism can benefit the altruist doesn't disprove altruistic motivation—we don't conclude egoism is fake when selfish acts incidentally benefit others.

### Attempted Resolutions

**The "Big Self" approach**: You have both a small self and a large self that encompasses others. Altruism toward small selves benefits your large self. Schopenhauer, Watts, and some Aristotle readings suggest this. Problem: still seems to reduce altruism to self-interest.

**The "Higher Self-Interest" approach**: There are tiers—basic needs (pleasure, security) and eudaimonic fulfillment. We sacrifice basic needs for eudaimonia. Problem: also collapses into self-interest.

**The Goal/Metagoal Distinction**: You have altruistic *goals* and an egoistic *metagoal* to have those goals (to be an altruist). When you act altruistically, you meet both—but you must act *to help the person*, not to become an altruist, or it won't work. This is how fairy tales work: if you help someone to get the reward, you don't get it.

**Altruism Exhibits (Rather Than Creates) Flourishing**: Once basic needs are met, you're free to pursue non-self-interested goals. Altruism isn't a strategy for improving welfare—it's a sign you've already improved it enough to have surplus to give.

> "The normal, healthy human being lives too much to live only for himself. He accumulates a surplus of life, a superabundance, which demands outlet." — Ray Madding McConnell

## Benefits of Altruism

### Health and Well-Being

Research links altruistic volunteering to better health outcomes—longer life, better self-rated health, better physical functioning—after adjusting for confounders. Causality is tricky but consistent.

### Evidence of Developmental Maturity

Developmental models (Kohlberg-style) track altruism development:
1. Egocentric accommodation
2. Instrumental cooperation
3. Mutual altruism (shared role obligations)
4. Conscientious altruism (social responsibility)
5. Autonomous altruism (universal dignity)
6. Universal self-sacrificial love (rare "moral saints")

### Reduces Pathological Self-Focus

Excessive self-focus (rumination, narcissism, hypochondria) harms well-being. Altruism directs attention outward, overcoming painful self-preoccupation.

> "In order to be successful... the main thing is for one to grow to the point where he completely forgets himself." — Booker T. Washington

### Demonstrates Thriving

Altruism flows from abundance—a legible sign of personal flourishing.

### Social Rewards

Society rewards altruists with praise and social capital, though the praised form isn't always genuine altruism. Obvious self-sacrifice draws more praise—we feel played if we praise someone acting in their own interest.

### Enables Cooperation

Successful cooperation requires willingness to subordinate personal gains to group welfare. Altruistic reputation enables productive partnerships and jumpstarts reciprocal altruism.

### Improves Romantic Relationships

Partners perceive genuinely altruistically motivated support as more sensitive and effective, associated with greater satisfaction.

## Criticisms of Altruism

### Self-Undermining

Maximalist altruism is perpetually demanding—there's always someone needier. If altruism governs society, doesn't this create a race to the bottom?

Also: if my purpose is helping others, and their purpose is helping others... what are we helping them *to*? Must eventually bottom out in egoistic gratification.

### Discourages Morality

Emphasizing self-sacrifice makes morality unappealing. Treating altruism as "purely selfless" creates false dichotomy: complete selflessness or pure self-interest.

### Can Be Unethical

Altruistic motives can mask unethical behavior. "I had no thought of gaining by it myself" sounds like an excuse. FTX is a cautionary tale.

### Often Biased and Poorly-Targeted

Empathy—the most reliable predictor of altruism—is demonstrably biased. We empathize more with people who are similar, nearby, or identifiable. This strengthens the case for *effective* altruism: don't take impulses at face value.

### Inefficient

When you give a gift, you inevitably give something less valuable to them than what they'd choose themselves. Philanthropy often has altruistic intentions but negligible or harmful consequences.

### Paternalistic

Altruists demonstrate power over recipients. Recipients carry psychological burdens of guilt. Gifts can implicitly say "here's something to help you along, dear little one."

### Awkward with State Power

If altruism is a duty, this may justify coercive mechanisms (welfare state, foreign aid). But if the state handles altruism, individual altruism may atrophy.

Praising philanthropic billionaires lets government off the hook.

Blood/organ donation debates: market compensation would increase supply, but unpaid donation builds social solidarity. Hard to buy "we're in this together" with cash.

### The Nietzsche Critique

Nietzsche believed altruism functions as corrupt, decadent egoism—a desperate adaptation when direct self-interest becomes taboo. He mocks attempts to reconcile egoism and altruism.

### The Ayn Rand Critique

Rand argued altruism as doctrine "holds need as a claim" and therefore "rewards an absence, a defect: weakness, inability, incompetence, suffering." It amounts to self-destruction.

Her counter: help people you *value*, for their sake *and* your own. If you help a friend selflessly, that implies you don't get value from helping them—strange way to indicate friendship.

## Characteristics of Altruists (Research Findings)

J. Philippe Rushton's summary (1980):

Altruists have:
- Internalized higher standards of justice and social responsibility
- More empathy and perspective-taking ability
- Consistent behavior across contexts (honesty, persistence, self-control)
- Integrated personality, strong personal efficacy, well-being, "integrity"

"Rescuers" (those who saved lives in Nazi Europe) also:
- Believed their choices mattered
- Were proactive about creating helping opportunities
- Regarded themselves as part of humanity
- Were ordinary people who believed their extraordinary actions were ordinary

## How to Cultivate Altruism

### Environmental Factors

People are more altruistic when:
- In a good mood (less after sad movies)
- After recent success or praise
- After unexpected gifts or good luck
- Not in competitive atmospheres
- Without distracting background noise
- Not feeling rushed

### Social Influence

Surprisingly: people are *less* likely to behave altruistically when observed or evaluated. Being watched interrupts empathy.

Role modeling helps—seeing ordinary people model skillful altruism is more effective than extreme philanthropic superstars.

### Positive Reinforcement

Express gratitude for others' altruism. Reward yourself when you behave altruistically.

> "If being altruistic feels good, lean into that. And then go ahead and toot your own horn."

### Develop Empathy

The empathy-altruism hypothesis is well-tested: "Empathic concern produces altruistic motivation."

Empathic concern = "other-oriented emotion elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need."

Two components:
1. Perceiving the other as in need
2. Valuing the other's welfare

You can hack this: if you induce perspective-taking, people come to value the person whose perspective they take.

Empathy training works—Pakistani deputy ministers who completed a one-month program increased blood donations, volunteering, and (with taxpayers' money) budget allocations to orphanages.

### Build Personal Capacity

You can be more helpful if your own needs are met. Two paths:
1. Accumulate enough that nothing is out of reach (problem: hedonic treadmill)
2. Simplify life so fewer things are necessities

Jeff Treseler's technique: choose a comfortable donation percentage now, plus a *much higher* percentage of any future income increase.

### Give Wisely

Aristotle: Most esteemed favor goes to those in great need, for important and hard-to-get things, at critical moments.

Cicero: Generosity should be proportional to past treatment, within our means, avoiding harm. Be generous with time and labor more than money—more appreciated, less depleting.

Effective altruists: Don't just help when opportunities arise—seek out opportunities to provide maximum assistance where most needed.

### Make It Habitual

Better to be altruistic regularly than occasionally. Habit-forming techniques:
- Implementation intentions: "When I get my paycheck, I will donate 15%"
- Graduated exposure: Start with small, easy acts
- Habit stacking: Link altruism to existing routines

## Related Concepts

- **Effective altruism**: Takes altruistic motivation as given, investigates efficiency
- **Empathy-altruism hypothesis**: Empathic concern → altruistic motivation (well-tested)
- **Gift love vs. need love** (C.S. Lewis): Emerges from fullness vs. void
- **Munkaholic eudaimonia**: Finding meaning through service work
- **Mutuality**: Business partnerships and free-market exchange as mutual altruism
- **Revealed preferences critique**: If you help others, you must prefer their welfare, so it's your own preference, so... (reinterprets rather than disproves)
