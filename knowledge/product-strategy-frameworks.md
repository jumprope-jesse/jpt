# Product Strategy Frameworks

Strategic frameworks for defining what to build and why. Distinct from development methodologies (how to build).

## The 5 Major Frameworks

### 1. Lean Startup Method
Build-measure-learn loop. Ship MVP fast, gather feedback, iterate or pivot.

- Launch basic version to validate interest before perfecting
- Learning from feedback determines if you stay course or pivot
- Pivot without abandoning existing work

**Best for:** Startups and new products in fast-moving markets
**Example:** Dropbox launched with a demo video to gauge interest before building

### 2. Form, Educate, Embed (FEE)
Ensure product stickiness through three phases:

- **Form:** Roll out product, spark initial interest
- **Educate:** Teach users through workshops, hands-on experience
- **Embed:** Weave into daily workflows until it feels essential

**Best for:** SaaS companies driving adoption of new features
**Example:** Slack's approach - promised email reduction, educated on features, became indispensable

### 3. Value Proposition Canvas
Map customer needs to product features:

1. Document customer jobs-to-be-done, pains, and desired gains
2. Map your product features against each point
3. Identify gaps and alignment

**Best for:** New companies defining offerings, or refining for specific segments
**Example:** Airbnb identified traveler needs (unique stays) + host needs (monetize space)

### 4. Blue Ocean Strategy
Create uncontested market space instead of fighting in crowded markets.

- Value innovation = combining novelty with desirability
- Goal: make competition irrelevant by playing in different league
- Stop fighting over existing customers, find untapped opportunities

**Best for:** Disrupting industries or creating new categories
**Example:** Cirque du Soleil eliminated circus animals, created high-end theatrical experience

### 5. Porter's Five Forces
Analyze competitive pressures to find advantages:

| Force | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| Threat of new entrants | Build brand loyalty, raise barriers |
| Supplier bargaining power | Diversify suppliers |
| Buyer bargaining power | Increase product uniqueness |
| Substitute threats | Leverage differentiators |
| Competitive rivalry | Specialize or find niches |

**Best for:** Established companies evaluating market position
**Example:** Uber analyzed driver bargaining power + taxi competition before entry

## Key Elements of Effective Strategy

1. **Vision alignment** - Product goals must serve company mission
2. **Market understanding** - Deep customer research (surveys, interviews, data)
3. **Measurable objectives** - Specific KPIs tied to company goals

## Common Mistakes

- Unrealistic initial goals (start with achievable wins)
- Communication silos between teams
- Building without customer feedback
- No KPIs to track progress
- Not adapting to market changes
