# Steelmanning Pitfalls

## Core Argument

Steelmanning (representing the strongest version of an opponent's argument) can paradoxically *prevent* genuine understanding in deep disagreements.

## Two Types of Persistent Disagreements

1. **Uncommon arguments** - Key arguments aren't in general circulation (rare)
2. **Large inferential gaps** - Incompatible worldviews requiring extended discourse (common)

## The Problem with Steelmanning

### Case 1: Socially Unacceptable Arguments
When an argument is more offensive than its conclusion, steelmanning tends to:
- Replace the actual argument with a weaker, more palatable version
- Lead to conclusions the interlocutor forgets within weeks
- Obscure the original reasoning chain

### Case 2: Deep Disagreements (The Insidious Case)
When crossing large inferential gaps:
- The steelmanner generates arguments *they themselves weren't convinced by*
- They substitute their own unconvincing argument for yours
- They refuse to engage with your actual (seemingly "dumb") argument
- Correcting them makes *you* look stubborn or foolish

> "The actual effect of steelmanning is simply to assume that the opposition is making an unconvincing argument that will leave you unmoved — which is pretty much the exact opposite of the principle of charity."

## When Steelmanning Works

- **Ephemeral disagreements** - Promotes civility, saves time
- **Intellectually unsophisticated interlocutors** - Creates goodwill (but is "polite condescension")

## Key Insight

If someone doesn't understand the reasoning underlying your actual argument, they cannot generate it on the spot. Steelmanning them generates *their best argument*, which by definition is one they already considered and weren't convinced by.

## Practical Application

In deep disagreements:
- Ask "Is that actually your argument?" before steelmanning
- Be willing to engage with arguments that seem weak on their face
- Recognize that persistent disagreements often involve reasoning chains you haven't fully grasped
- "Feeling flustered about having called someone stupid" is actually useful epistemic feedback
