# Idea Black Holes & Rationality

Framework for recognizing and escaping ideological traps—when people fall into belief systems and their evaluation criteria shifts to match the ideology they're falling into.

## The Core Problem: Evaluation Gravity

Just as particles can fall into a black hole and never escape, people can get stuck on ideas, cross an "event horizon," and never come back. These idea black holes manifest as identity-defining ideologies—philosophy, interests, career, politics.

**Evaluation gravity:** As an idea convinces you (even just landing a few good points), your evaluation rubric shifts to value that idea more. This creates a vicious cycle—the idea informs the criteria you use to evaluate it.

### Example: Crypto Excitement

1. Decentralized finance is interesting, rubric shifts toward valuing decentralization
2. Other technology spaces become unexciting by comparison
3. Crypto becomes positioned as "accepted truth" about the future
4. Identity forms: "crypto-bro"
5. Now defending even ridiculous projects because it's "their" space

### Example: Hypermasculinity/Alpha Culture

1. Disaffected young men encounter success-driven stoicism messaging
2. The advice about working hard and self-improvement is genuinely logical
3. Logic gets framed as a trait of being "alpha"
4. Rubric shifts to place more value on "alpha-ness"
5. Eventually pulled past the event horizon

**Key insight:** From outside, it looks ridiculous. But consider how many views you find ridiculous—someone else likely finds your views equally so.

## Detecting the Trap: The Personal Horizon

**Personal horizon:** The amount of time ago when you were substantively unrecognizable from who you are now.

- Yesterday's you seems similar to today's you
- Walk far enough back and you find someone who makes very different decisions
- That distance is your personal horizon

**Diagnostic use:**
- Long personal horizon = possible sign you're stuck in a black hole
- People in black holes make similar decisions over long periods
- If you don't feel different from past versions of yourself, you may be engulfed

The horizon varies—sometimes years, sometimes months, sometimes days after monumental change.

## Three Escape Strategies

### 1. Fallibilism (vs. Hubris)

**Core principle:** You are wrong often. Confidence can be imagination.

- Approach every ideological debate as a 50/50
- Continuing with long-held perspectives is easier than changing, but aim for good ideas, not easy ones
- Within a black hole, beliefs are unquestionable—that's dogmatic thinking
- Any idea, no matter how fundamental, must be questionable
- Good ideas survive scrutiny; bad ideas break down under better tools

### 2. Hill-Climbing with Randomness (vs. Indoctrination)

The classic optimization problem: you're placed somewhere and want to reach the highest hill. Naive solution climbs the nearest hill, but unless you started on the highest hill by luck, you'll never find the global maximum.

**Solution:** Introduce randomness. Wander before climbing.

Applied to ideas:
- Frequently complete "random walks" beyond your current position
- Expose yourself to ideological culture shocks
- Do things uncomfortable to you
- This creates a more balanced evaluation rubric

**Practical example:** A two-week meditation retreat in Nepal forced reinterpretation of "truths" previously held. Even arriving at the same conclusions, the rigor of analysis was stronger.

### 3. Shrinking Your Identity (vs. Evaluation Gravity)

Less identity = less mass = less gravitational pull toward black holes.

**The problem with labels:**
- Myers-Briggs is pseudo-science
- Political Compass is un-nuanced
- Yet we love categories and Buzzfeed quizzes

**The solution:**
- Minimize identity
- Evaluate each idea separately
- Break any ideology into a series of sub-ideas ranked from good to bad
- You can act like a specific identity by choice, not necessity
- "Identity necessitates; being identity-less enables you to chase what you desire because you are free of need"

## Are These Strategies Themselves a Black Hole?

Dogmatic beliefs tend to be **convergent**—they limit beliefs, ideas, principles to those deemed "true" or "righteous."

**Testing each strategy:**

1. **Fallibilism** - Inherently anti-dogmatic. Doesn't instruct you to believe in fallibilism; suggests you examine things and assume misconceptions. Recursive: can examine fallibilism with itself.

2. **Hill-climbing** - Randomness doesn't exponentially promote more randomness. Sometimes random means repetition. Doesn't converge into dogmatic randomness.

3. **Shrinking identity** - Less identity means less attachment to specific ideologies. Enables rather than necessitates.

**Conclusion:** These strategies promote divergence, not convergence. They give freedom to explore, not prescriptions to follow.

## Key Takeaways

**If an idea seems compelling:**
- Check if it's creating evaluation gravity for you

**If your personal horizon is far:**
- Identify beliefs you've held as unwaveringly true

**If you're trapped:**
- Understand ideas are flawed
- Explore randomly
- Decrease attachment to identity

**If you want to never fall in:**
- Impossible. Do your best to avoid convergent ideas.

**If you want the best ideas:**
- Recognize this is a flawed aspiration, then do your best
- Even fundamental, correct ideas should be viewed with fallibilism
- Knowledge warps and shifts over time
- "It would involve intense hubris to truly believe that we are any different from past mistake-making humans"
