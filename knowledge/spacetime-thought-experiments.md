## Key Premise

Three imagined scenarios lead many physicists to doubt that space-time is fundamental. These thought experiments suggest space-time may be emergent rather than a fundamental feature of reality.

## Context

This connects to ongoing debates in theoretical physics about:
- Whether space-time is continuous or discrete at the smallest scales
- How quantum mechanics and general relativity might be unified
- The holographic principle and its implications
- Black hole information paradox and firewall debates
