## Nietzsche's Project: Liberation from "Morality"

Nietzsche aims to liberate readers from everything called "morality": happiness, altruism, equality, compassion, asceticism. He distinguishes:

**Slave morality** (Judeo-Christian):
- Emphasizes happiness, altruism, equality, compassion
- Concern for the victim, the poor, the "little guy"
- Values: meekness, chastity, poverty, turning the other cheek

**Master morality** (Pagan/Greco-Roman):
- Inegalitarian, elitist
- Embraces suffering as useful
- Severe self-love over altruism
- Taste for danger
- Indifference to others' suffering; willingness to use others as instruments
- Indulgence in animalistic desires

**Nietzsche's goal**: The production of "higher men" (creative geniuses like Beethoven, Goethe, Shakespeare). He argues egalitarian morality produces mediocrity and limits greatness.

## Good/Bad vs. Good/Evil

Nietzsche (as philologist) traces the etymology:

**Master morality: Good and Bad**
- "Good" roots: noble, aristocratic, high-minded, privileged
- "Bad" roots: plain, simple, common
- First act of evaluation: **self-affirmation** ("I am good")
- Then: others are bad (absence of goodness, not presence of evil)

**Slave morality: Good and Evil**
- First establishes "evil" = what masters call good (jealousy, resentment)
- Then "good" = the opposite of masters
- Ambition → greed; confidence → pride; strength → wrath
- First act: **reactive negation** ("You are evil")

## Ressentiment (Resentment)

The psychological mechanism driving slave morality:

> "Resentment is the state where you feel bad, where you feel unpleasant, but there's nothing you can do about the source of that unpleasantness. And because you can't change the world, you change your interpretation of the world."

**The fox and the grapes**: Can't get grapes → grapes are sour anyway.

### The Author's Personal Example

Dropped out of college to build a company → failed → turned to Buddhist/Christian philosophy emphasizing rejection of worldly desires. Nietzsche exposed this as ressentiment: "I was mad at myself, and I was envious of my peers who had dropped out, who had built successful companies."

The otherworldly turn wasn't genuine enlightenment—it was a way to more forcibly reject what he'd failed at: "Those silly entrepreneurs, don't they know all desire is suffering and all ambition is vanity?"

### Three Critiques of Slave Morality

**1. Internal Psychology**
- Slaves are negative, naysayers; primary act is to say "bad, bad, bad"
- They don't stand for anything, only against things
- Internal psychology: seething hate, loathing, envy

- Masters are yes-sayers; first act is self-affirmation
- Surplus of confidence → indifference, cool nonchalance to external world
- Not easily offended; walks away cheerful even after atrocities

**2. Bad Values**
The slaves simply flipped what masters like:
- Greco-Roman myths: by victors, for victors, about victors
- Christianity: by victims, for victims, about victims (Moses not Pharaoh, Abel not Cain, Joseph not his brothers)

The slaves don't genuinely hold their values:
> "The inoffensiveness of the weak one, cowardice itself... acquires good names here, such as 'patience'... not being able to avenge oneself is called not wanting to avenge oneself, perhaps even forgiveness."

**Don't confuse impotence for virtue.**

**3. Hypocrisy**
Christian "love" purports to be objective justice but is really pagan vengeance repackaged. Nietzsche cites punishment in hell—no possibility of moral improvement, so what's the purpose?

Tertullian's gleeful description of watching sinners punished in hell: "Does that sound like love?"

## The Invention of Free Will

Slave morality introduces free will to further blame masters and praise themselves.

**The lambs and eagles parable**:
> "These birds of prey are evil; and whoever is as little as possible a bird of prey but rather its opposite, a lamb, isn't he good?"

It's ridiculous for lambs to blame eagles for hunting (it's their nature) or praise themselves for not hunting (they couldn't even if they wanted to).

Nietzsche's view: masterly and slavish humans differ like eagles and lambs. Our natures, not free choices, determine actions. The slaves invent free will to enable blame.

## The Validity of Ad Hominem

Nietzsche's key insight: our psychology/interests determine our philosophical worldviews, not reasoning from first principles.

> "Every great philosophy so far has been... the personal confession of its author and a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir."

**Socrates is ugly** → no wonder he devalued the material world and elevated abstract forms. "If I had the ugliest nose, but the biggest brain in all of Athens, I too would spend all my time thinking."

Ad hominem arguments aren't just valid—they're *necessary* to understand thought.

## The Ascetic Ideal

### The Priests

A third class in the master/slave war with three key qualities:
1. Like slaves: sickly (of spirit—negative, gloomy, depressive)
2. Like masters: strong will to power
3. Unlike both: very intelligent

Modern approximation: progressive intellectuals who side with victims against oppressors.

### Asceticism as Will to Power

**Social control**: Denying oneself (food, sex, money, reputation) creates political legitimacy. If someone has denied life's most important desires, "he must have gotten something else, he must have transcended."

Example: The High Sparrow in Game of Thrones—his powerlessness is precisely what gives him power.

Example: Tibetan monastery rituals—prostrating before a "selfless" master who sits on a golden cushion in a feudal theocracy.

### Asceticism as "Willing Nothingness"

The philosopher's asceticism: poverty, chastity, humility aren't chosen for virtue—they're the ideal conditions for pursuing philosophy.

- Poverty: possessions bring obligations that distract from truth-seeking
- Humility: don't want to be bothered by people
- Chastity: philosophers already have a channel for immortality—their books

The pure ascetic denies life for the sake of denying life. Buddhism's early goal: cessation of desire, leaving existence entirely.

> "Man would much rather will nothingness than not will."

**First canon law of the Council of Nicaea**: Don't chop your penis off. (Too many early ascetics were doing it.) This demonstrates will to power—they'd rather actively destroy than passively abstain.

## Why Christianity Won

Two psychological appeals to both masters and slaves:

### 1. The Need for Cruelty

Humans want to exercise cruelty. When civilization prevents external cruelty, we turn it inward → self-cruelty → inner world develops.

> "The entire inner world, originally thin as if inserted between two skins, has spread and unfolded... to the same extent that man's outward discharging has been obstructed."

Self-cruelty needs justification → priests provide it: **You are guilty, you are to blame.**

### 2. The Problem of Suffering

Suffering needs meaning. Blaming others (masters blame gods, slaves blame masters) doesn't fully answer "why me?"

Priests' ingenious solution: **You are suffering because you are at fault.**

All five major world religions answer suffering this way: sin (Abrahamic), karma (Hindu/Buddhist). This gives suffering meaning and provides a way out (deny yourself → ascetic ideal).

## Christianity's Suicide via Science

The ascetic ideal "truth at all costs" is Christian. Early scientists like Galileo sacrificed everything for truth—a religious devotion.

> "What actually triumphed over the Christian god?... Christian morality itself, the ever more strictly understood concept of truthfulness... translated and sublimated into the scientific conscience."

Christianity gave birth to science, which destroyed Christianity.

## Limitations of Nietzsche's Critique

### 1. Exaggerated Will to Power

Nietzsche projects his own high will-to-power onto all humanity:

> "By prescribing 'love of one's neighbor' the ascetic priest is basically prescribing... the will to power."

Is resentment the essence or merely a likely perversion of egalitarian movements? Probably just perversion. Most people are fine with affirming value systems that don't affirm themselves.

### 2. Heroic Individualism is Naive

Nietzsche's positive ideal is always "the sovereign individual, the individual resembling only himself." But sociality always interpenetrates us. We can't evaluate sanely without recognition.

The jock's indifference comes not from nature but from *others praising him*. Nietzsche ignores how recognition enables the confidence he admires.

### 3. Nietzsche's Life Was That of a Loser

If Nietzsche blames Socrates' metaphysics on his ugliness, we can blame Nietzsche's obsession with power on his failures:
- Chronic sickness → insanity
- Barely scraping by on university pension
- Rejection by multiple women
- Had to self-fund publishing his books
- So little recognition in his sane years

Those attracted to Nietzsche uncritically are rarely the Ubermensch—they're sickly, marginalized, resentful people like Nietzsche himself.

> "I've been too convinced by Nietzsche to be convinced by the rhetoric of the sick."

## Key Takeaways for Personal Reflection

From the lecture's opening notes (application to life):

1. **Self-Reflection**: Reflect on aspirations beyond societal norms
2. **Critique of Herd Morality**: Evaluate your values as father/leader—encourage authenticity over conformity
3. **Resentment vs. Empowerment**: Acknowledge resentment but focus on empowerment and creativity; avoid victimhood
4. **Ascetic Ideal**: Question sacrifices made for traditional success—are you sacrificing joy for societal approval?
5. **Children's Values**: Encourage greatness while recognizing complexity of morality
6. **Work-Life Balance**: Prioritize leisure for creativity (Nietzsche: leisure is necessary for greatness)
7. **Embrace Struggle**: Greatness often emerges from challenge—opportunities for growth
8. **Balance with Community**: Contemporary thinkers advocate collaboration over pure individualism
9. **Legacy**: Are you cultivating a path of greatness aligned with your values?
