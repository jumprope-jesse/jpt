# Personality Basins: An RLHF Model of Human Development

A mental model for reasoning about personality as a reinforcement learning process, where environment shapes who you become through feedback loops—and how to escape local optima.

## Core Framework

Your personality forms through a process conceptually similar to **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**:

1. Born with initial traits in a given environment
2. Perform interactions with environment
3. If interaction goes well → more likely to repeat it
4. If interaction goes poorly → less likely to repeat it

The result: you converge into a **personality basin**—a local optimum in personality-space that solidifies over time as you choose friend groups, careers, aesthetic preferences, etc.

### The Loss Landscape Metaphor

Imagine a multidimensional loss landscape where:
- Each point represents a possible personality
- Lower points = personalities more successful in your environment
- Your path through life = gradient descent toward local minima
- Basins = stable personality configurations you settle into

Just like in ML training, you try many approaches and do more of what works.

## Key Insights

### 1. Most Personality Changes Are Unconscious

Your brain makes millions of gradient updates daily based on what's going well. Conscious decisions to change are the exception, not the norm.

> "This is why techniques like nonviolent communication, dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness have observation and introspection as a core facet, because it's something that you have to consciously practice to become good at rather than something you're born with."

**Self-experiment**: Pick a random personality trait and ask: "Why am I like this? Could I imagine a version of myself that is not like this, and if so, what happened differently to them?"

### 2. Experience is f(stimuli, personality, environment)

Your conscious experience isn't just about the stimulus—it's a function of:
- The stimulus itself
- Your personality (priors, associations)
- Your environment (social context, who you're with)

This explains why your friend thinks your favorite song sounds terrible—they're literally experiencing something different.

### 3. Personality-Space Is Adversarial

Your training data consists of other RL agents, many of whom want different things from you. This leads to **Personality Capture**—when your environment RLHFs you into a personality that benefits others rather than yourself.

Examples:
- School bully threatening you → shaping you to comply
- Social media feeds → shaping you to maximize their engagement
- Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable (low ability to recognize optimization pressure)

> "The reason it's so hard to put your phone away is because it's a battlefield of yourself versus thousands of intelligent and well-compensated engineers trying their hardest to ensure you do just the opposite."

### 4. High-Magnitude Gradients Cause Rapid Change

Different experiences produce different gradient magnitudes:
- **High-magnitude**: psychedelics, trauma, religious events, love, gambling, sex
- **Low-magnitude**: ordinary daily interactions

High-magnitude experiences can push you far in personality-space quickly—for better or worse.

> "Whatever happens to you during your experience will be fed to you via high-magnitude gradients. Because users may experience hallucinations and delusional thinking during usage of such drugs, it's possible for their location in personality-space to be thrown far out-of-distribution."

## How to Leave Your Personality Basin

### 1. Change Your Environment

If you and your environment are constant, you shouldn't expect to end up in a different basin. For every new environment exists a new optimal-you.

- Move cities or countries
- Change careers
- Enter new social circles
- Try drastically different activities

### 2. Increase Your Learning Rate

Your learning rate automatically increases when environment changes. Ways to boost it:
- Try new things (new environments, new people)
- Long walks in nature vs. cubicle sitting
- Novel experiences

### 3. Don't Solidify Too Early

Parents and schooling environment have disproportionate influence during adolescence. Once you gain adult independence:
- Force yourself to try many new things
- Consider moving away from where you were born
- Experiment with different career paths

> "The potential return is literally life-changing."

## Personality Basins and Mental Illness

This model illuminates why some conditions are hard to treat:

### Depression as a Deep Basin

You need a very large gradient update to escape:
- **All at once**: Strong positive stimuli (e.g., ketamine increases learning rate)
- **Gradual**: Small positive gradient updates over months/years (CBT)

### Addiction as Personality Capture

Drugs personality-capture you into a basin that feeds on them:
- Basin deepens due to high-magnitude gradients
- Relapsing = falling back to bottom of basin
- Tapering = small continual gradient updates

### Trauma's Function

Trauma's purpose: avoid really bad things happening again. It was more adaptive in ancestral environments where you couldn't easily change your surroundings.

## Multi-Dimensional Personality

You can model yourself as having multiple sub-basins:
- Different "you" around family vs. friends vs. coworkers
- Different moods as different sub-basins within your overall basin
- Compatible with internal family systems or dissociative identity disorder frameworks

## Connection to Other Ideas

### Related to "Locally Optimal Psychology"

Both frameworks share:
- Symptoms/personality traits make sense in context
- Direct fighting backfires—understanding root causes is key
- Local optima can trap you even when suboptimal

**Difference**: Local optimality emphasizes protection ("what is this defending against?"); personality basins emphasize environmental shaping ("what feedback created this?")

### Related to Self-Defeating Spirals

Both describe feedback loops that solidify patterns:
- Spirals: small negative cues → confirmation bias → calcified beliefs
- Basins: environmental feedback → gradient updates → stabilized personality

### Related to the Attention Economy Critique

Personality capture explains how apps and platforms shape users:
- High optimization pressure from engineers
- Children especially vulnerable
- Competitive memeplexes "hijack evolution's distortions"

## Practical Implications

1. **Your personality is more malleable than you think**—but only if you change your environment
2. **Be wary of what's shaping you**—especially high-engagement platforms and high-stakes social situations
3. **Adolescence isn't the only formative period**—you can create high-learning-rate periods by seeking novelty
4. **Mental health interventions work by escaping basins**—either through large gradient updates or accumulated small ones
5. **Social dynamics are adversarial**—others are constantly applying RLHF pressure, often unconsciously
