## What Are Wicked Problems?

A **wicked problem** is one whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point. The challenge is not domain, technical, or mechanical complexity—it's **social complexity**.

Key properties of wicked problems:
1. Not properly understood until after formulating a solution
2. No stopping rule (no clear criteria for being "solved")
3. Solutions aren't right or wrong in a binary way
4. Every wicked problem is essentially novel and unique
5. Every solution is a "one-shot operation" (can't try it out / evolve it)
6. No given alternative solutions

## Classic Examples

Global-scale: COVID-19 response, national debt/inflation, migration policy, climate change, traffic congestion, addiction prevention.

These polarize opinions, escalate conflicts, slow/prevent action, and create frustration and helplessness.

## How Work Environments Create Wicked Problems

Any work environment can grow "standard" problems into "wicked" ones. It doesn't take a nation—just a few individuals with colliding standpoints, misaligned goals, and oversized egos.

**Familiar examples in tech:**
- "Which web framework for our next project?"
- "How to deal with 5 years of accumulated tech debt?"
- "How to unify logging across X teams?"
- "Old way vs new way components—how to fix this?"

These problems keep popping up at meetings, people vent for 40 minutes until exhausted, then move to the next agenda item without anything conclusive.

## Common Failure Patterns

Instead of solving the most important problem:
- We focus on ones we're comfortable with (e.g., technical instead of business)
- We mix separate co-existing problems and get lost in overlapping impacts
- We mistake visible symptoms for root problems (symptoms are cheaper to "fix")

## Strategies for Avoiding Wicked Problems

**Keep unrelated social issues out:**
- Put politics, religion, and inherently wicked social topics outside the work environment
- Don't mix in problems that are inherently unsolvable

**Clarify decision-making:**
- Make sure decision-making policy is clear
- Everyone knows who makes the decision (the "owner")
- Avoid "direct democracy" and committees as decision mechanisms

**Structure the process:**
- Clearly separate diverging phases (brainstorming, building alternatives) from converging phases (eliminating options, determining direction)
- Have someone dedicated to "discussion hygiene"—avoiding re-iteration, derailing edge cases, watered-down issues

**Maintain clarity:**
- Separate facts from opinions—we're emotionally attached to opinions, but decisions should be based on facts
- Build "bias toward action"—one can always find reasons not to do something (safer, less accountability), but action drives progress

**Break down the problem:**
- Dissect into smaller, independent problems
- Makes decision burden more bearable
- Fewer factors to consider
- Decisions become reversible/adjustable

## Key Insight

The transition from "poorly-defined problem" to "wicked problem" happens when social complexity overtakes technical complexity. The solution isn't smarter analysis—it's better social structures around decision-making.
