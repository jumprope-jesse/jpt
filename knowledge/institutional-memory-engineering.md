# Institutional Memory in Engineering Organizations

Source: [Rob Landley - Institutional Memory and Reverse Smuggling](https://landley.net/history/mirror/institutional_memory.html)

A firsthand account from a petrochemical engineer about how organizations forget how their own systems work.

## The Two Forms of Institutional Memory

1. **People** - Remember how things work and why
2. **Documentation** - Written records stored somewhere

Both are vulnerable. People leave, documents disappear/rot/are forgotten.

## Case Study: The Forgotten Plant

A petrochemical plant built in the early 1980s still operates and makes money, but the company has forgotten how it really works. They know day-to-day operations but not the underlying design rationale.

### Contributing Factors

1. **Hiring moratoriums** - Oil downturn in 80s-90s created age gaps (everyone was 55+ or 35-, few in between)
2. **Technology transitions** - Move to computer-based design without preserving older methods
3. **Office moves** - Physical reorganizations scattered documentation
4. **Mergers** - Corporate restructuring dissolved the original design group

### Institutional Archaeology

When the company later wanted to expand the plant, they faced:
- Multiple conflicting names for the same plant (colloquial, official, joint venture, project IDs)
- Document management systems pointing to other document management systems
- Digitization that promised to solve problems but created new ones
- Physical libraries closed, addresses no longer existing

The breakthrough came from the old R&D library - dusty filing cabinets with paper blueprints sporting IDs claiming they'd been "digitized" at some point (the digital archive long lost).

## Deciphering Old Documentation

Even with documents in hand, challenges remained:
- Methods and notation long obsolete
- Cultural assumptions about what's "obvious" have changed
- No big-picture overview - "What This Goddamn Plant Is: And How It Works"

> "Engineering schools should teach a course in engineering archaeology, where students are given a pile of 30-year old documents and asked to figure out what's going on."

## Reverse Corporate Espionage

The retired engineer was hired as a consultant to explain to the company how its own plant worked.

**The irony of unofficial documentation:**
- During reorganizations, engineers made private copies of documents to avoid delays
- These bootleg copies were the only surviving source
- Had to "smuggle" them back into the company - officially the company "had" them, but actually didn't
- As external consultant, wasn't allowed to know trade secrets he'd personally invented

> "I'd love to read a study of reverse corporate espionage, where companies forget their own secrets and employees have to unofficially get them back. I'm convinced it happens more than you'd think."

## Key Insights

### Document Management Paradoxes
- Attempts to fix document management caused some of the problems
- Digital systems can create false confidence ("it's in the system somewhere")
- Physical libraries have value - one surviving local library saved critical documents

### Maintaining Continuity
- Continuous age gradient in workforce prevents "memory cliffs"
- When one cohort retires together, decades of context disappears
- Overlap periods between generations are critical

### The Archaeology Metaphor

> "The more I look around, the more the engineering world, once you go back more than a few years, looks like subterranean New York City. A mass of strange engineering feats humming away out of sight, produced by long-forgotten ancient peoples, leaving only fragmentary maps and diagrams."

## Relevance

### For Engineering Leadership
- Documentation isn't just for compliance - it's for the future
- The person who should write "how this works" is never the same person who needs to read it
- Commissioning a "system overview" book at project end would be valuable

### For Knowledge Management
- Multiple redundant formats have value (paper survives digitization failures)
- Local/distributed copies prevent central points of failure
- Informal/unofficial documentation often survives official systems

### For Hiring
- Age diversity in teams preserves cross-generational knowledge transfer
- Hiring freezes create dangerous knowledge gaps decades later
- Overlap periods during transitions are investments, not inefficiencies
