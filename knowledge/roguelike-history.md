# The History of Rogue and the Roguelike Genre

Source: Interview with Glenn Wichman (spillhistorie.no, 2024)

## Origins (1978-1980)

Rogue was created by Glenn Wichman and Michael Toy as freshmen at UC Santa Cruz in 1978-1980. Ken Arnold (creator of the `curses` library at Berkeley) joined later when Toy transferred to Berkeley.

### The Technical Foundation

The game was only possible because of Bill Joy's `vi` editor and Ken Arnold's `curses` library:
- Early terminals worked like printers - text scrolled up, no cursor positioning
- Different terminal brands had incompatible escape codes
- `curses` abstracted terminal differences, allowing programs to treat the screen as an addressable 2D space
- This made ASCII "graphics" games possible

### Key Design Decisions

**Procedural generation**: Wichman and Toy wanted "a game that could surprise even its creators" - the dungeon would be generated by the computer, solving the problem that text adventures were boring to their own creators.

**Simplified D&D**: Direct inspiration from Dungeons & Dragons, with monster stats originally copied from D&D rules. Later refined to be more original.

**Balanced complexity**:
- 26 monsters (one per letter A-Z)
- 26 dungeon levels
- Single character class (no races/classes to configure)
- Easy to learn, notoriously hard to beat
- "You did not have to beat it to enjoy it"

## Distribution and Influence

### UNIX Bundle Effect

Rogue was included in the Berkeley UNIX distribution (BSD), making it available on college campuses worldwide. This was like being bundled with Windows - enormous reach for free.

The audience was computer science students - future game developers. Wichman: "For coders who wanted to make games, this was often the first game they encountered in an environment where they could take that inspiration and then make their own game."

### Commercial Versions (1984)

- IBM PC version by Jon Lane and Michael Toy (A.I. Design)
- Published by Epyx
- Later: Macintosh, Atari ST, Amiga, C64 versions
- **Not commercially successful** - by 1984, expectations had changed

Wichman on failure: "We really never sat down and said, 'What does Rogue need to be to compete in today's marketplace?' We just knew there was demand from people who had played Rogue on their college computers."

## The "Roguelike" Term

The term became official around 1993 via Usenet newsgroups (rec.games.roguelike.*). It was a naming convention for discussion categories that stuck.

## Wichman's Perspective on Modern Games

Surprising take: His favorite "roguelike" is **Minecraft**. "I think if I had just kept working on Rogue constantly over the years, what I would have ended up with would look very much like Minecraft."

Other games he considers spiritual successors: Diablo, No Man's Sky, Spelunky (matches his original light-hearted vision).

## Design Wisdom

On beating the game (which Wichman himself never did):

> "The people who do beat Rogue never ever hit a key twice in a row without waiting to see the consequences of the previous move, reevaluate, and calculate. You need a good strategy of course but you need to treat it as a turn-based puzzle game to survive."

And: "Hitting the keys harder will not do more damage."

## Genre Characteristics

What defines a roguelike (evolved over time):
1. Procedurally generated environments/challenges
2. Rich, dynamic selection of tools/items
3. Permanent consequences / permadeath
4. Limitations on save-scumming

Originally also: turn-based, ASCII graphics - but these became less central.

## Legacy

Rogue's influence tree:
- Direct: Hack (1982), Moria (1983), NetHack
- Genre-adjacent: Diablo (and all ARPGs that followed)
- Modern roguelikes: Hades, Dead Cells, Slay the Spire, Vampire Survivors
- Broader influence: Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, Rimworld
