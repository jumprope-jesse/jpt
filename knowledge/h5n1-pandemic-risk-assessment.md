## Influenza Basics

**Naming**: Influenza A has two surface proteins - hemagglutinin (18 types) and neuraminidase (11 types). Strains named by combination: H3N2, H5N1, etc.

**Evolution**: Flu evolved in birds, crossed to humans multiple times. Pandemic flus happen when new strains cross from animals to humans.

**Reassortment**: Bird flu can "reassort" with human flu (kind of like viral sex) to create new strains. Pigs can be infected by both, making them common reassortment sites - hence "swine flu."

## Pandemic History

| Year | Strain | Origin | Deaths |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1918 | H1N1 (Spanish) | Birds→US | 50M |
| 1957 | H2N2 (Asian) | Birds→China | 2M |
| 1968 | H3N2 (Hong Kong) | Pigs?→HK | 2M |
| 1977 | H1N1 (Russian) | Lab leak? | Low |
| 2009 | H1N1 (Swine) | Birds/pigs→Mexico | 200K |

Key insight: Severity depends on both virus virulence AND immune system match. 1918 killed more 18-28 year olds because they'd been primed on H3N8 (1890s), while 88+ year olds had H1N1 antibodies from 1830.

## H5N1 Timeline

- 1959: First found in Scottish chickens
- 1996: Geese in China
- 2022: Found in minks (mammal adaptation)
- 2024: Spread to US cattle (16 states), California emergency declared
- Oct 2024: First found in pigs

## Risk Assessment (as of Jan 2025)

**Pandemic probability next year**: ~5% (Metaculus estimate)
- Manifold says 40%, but Metaculus more reliable (won head-to-head comparisons, better quality comments, CDC-sponsored forecasting tournament)

**If pandemic occurs, severity estimates**:
- 30%: About as bad as seasonal flu
- 63%: 2-10x worse (like Hong Kong flu 1968)
- 6%: 10-100x worse (like Spanish flu 1918)
- <1%: >100x worse (unprecedented)

**The 50% CFR myth is FAKE**: Official stats only capture hospitalized cases. US 2024: 0/61 deaths. True CFR estimate: ~1.25% (wide CI: 0.5-7%).

**Expected value calculation**: 5% pandemic × 7% Spanish-flu-level = 0.35% chance of catastrophic pandemic this year (~1 in 300). By EV, ~167K deaths in expectation.

## Forecasting Notes

Metaculus vs Manifold:
- Metaculus: Steady estimates, better track record, higher quality comments, CDC respiratory disease tournament experience
- Manifold: Swings 2x week-to-week, shallower analysis

The 5% feels low given all the news, but matches base rate (5 pandemics in 100 years). Monitoring collapses uncertainty: we know H5N1 is the threat, other strains aren't giving red flags. Maybe add 2.5% for surprise strains → 7.5% total flu pandemic risk.

## Practical Notes

- Raw milk: CDC warns against during H5N1 cow epidemic. Pasteurized milk safe.
- Vaccines exist for humans/chickens, but stockpiles cover only a few % of population. Pandemic strain may evade current vaccines anyway.
- Mink farms: Exceptional zoonotic risk, entire US industry only $80M/year - maybe just buy them out?
