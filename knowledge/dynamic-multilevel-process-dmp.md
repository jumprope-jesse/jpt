## Overview

The DMP is a cognitive framework that segments mental processing into four levels, each with distinct characteristics. The premise: we often process information at the "wrong" level for the situation.

## The Four Levels

### 1. Elemental Level
- **Focus**: Instinctive, automatic processing
- **Base**: Limbic system/brainstem
- **Example**: Fight-or-flight responses
- **Key characteristic**: Direct input-output relationship
- **Transition up**: When learned memory becomes more important than genetic memory

### 2. Emotional Level
- **Focus**: Learned stimulus-response patterns
- **Base**: Limbic system/amygdala
- **Example**: Learning from pain/pleasure associations
- **Key characteristic**: Pattern recognition and conditioned responses
- **Transition up**: When collective emotions become more important than individual

### 3. Social Level
- **Focus**: Relational information processing
- **Base**: Prefrontal cortex/mirror system
- **Example**: Empathy-based decision making
- **Key characteristic**: Multi-agent consideration
- **Transition up**: When abstract information becomes more important than social emotions

### 4. Intellectual Level
- **Focus**: Pure abstract/analytical processing
- **Base**: Prefrontal cortex/association areas
- **Example**: Mathematical problem solving
- **Key characteristic**: Context-independent analysis

## Framework Utility

Three claimed applications:
1. **Managing complexity** - Identify which processing "drawer" needs attention
2. **Generating states** - Like energy levels in atoms, shift between levels intentionally
3. **Improving decisions** - Match decision approach to appropriate level

## Critical Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Maps to established neuroscience (loosely)
- Provides vocabulary for discussing processing modes
- Transition triggers offer practical check-points

**Limitations:**
- Author's personal synthesis, not validated framework
- Levels may not be as discrete as presented
- The military training example feels contrived
- Unclear how to reliably identify "correct" level

## Related Frameworks

- Kahneman's System 1/System 2 (simpler, more validated)
- Maslow's hierarchy (similar layering concept)
- MacLean's triune brain (evolutionary basis)
