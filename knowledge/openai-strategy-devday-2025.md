# OpenAI Strategy and Vision (DevDay 2025)

*Source: [Stratechery Interview with Sam Altman](https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-openai-ceo-sam-altman-about-devday-and-the-ai-buildout/) - October 2025*

## Core Vision

**Goal:** Build AGI/superintelligence and deploy it in a way that benefits people across all aspects of their lives.

**Key thesis:** Most people will want to have ONE AI service integrated across their whole life - work, personal, different devices, different apps. ChatGPT is building toward being that unified AI helper.

## Three Pillars

### 1. Infrastructure
- Massive buildout with partners: Nvidia, AMD, Samsung, SK hynix, Oracle
- Infrastructure is "brutally difficult" - needs electrons, physical infrastructure, power equipment, chip fab capacity, racks, consumer demand simultaneously
- OpenAI is helping partners with financing at scale ahead of revenue
- Altman's investor background uniquely useful: "understanding capital allocation in a world where you can have these crazy exponentials"

### 2. Product
- Apps in ChatGPT - third-party apps integrated directly (Zillow example)
- Instant Checkout for commerce
- Consumer + Enterprise converging (like Google - same tool everywhere)
- API business enables "sign in with OpenAI" continuity across services
- Codex in terminal, device apps - all connected to one relationship with AI

### 3. Research
- Altman "never been more optimistic" about research direction
- This is why making big infrastructure bets now

## Apps in ChatGPT Philosophy

Previous attempts (plugins, GPTs) had mixed success. New approach differs:
- Partners control their own UI (not just returning raw data to ChatGPT)
- Users have direct relationship with the other site
- Explicit linking of accounts
- Suggests by name, calls by name

**Why this approach:** Altman felt strongly about building something the whole ecosystem benefits from, especially enabling new startups to "rocket into existence" on the platform.

## Business Model Insights

### On Ads
- "There probably is some cool ad product we can do that is a net win to the user"
- Praises Instagram ads as value-adding (not the typical "tax" of internet ads)
- Affiliate seems like "clear win"

### On Subscriptions
- ChatGPT has demonstrated people's willingness to pay for AI
- "Should be at least somewhat an update" to assumptions about subscription potential

### On Sora Economics
- Heavy usage is "funny memes to send to three friends" - no ad model supports that
- "People are just going to have to pay for generations in some cases"

## On Competition

- Doesn't expect winner-take-all, even in consumer
- "Very big tech companies... kind of misstepped in the period after [ChatGPT launch] and it let us build up some leverage"
- Google "doing incredible work now, but clearly they didn't in that first period"
- AI will "seep everywhere into every consumer product and every enterprise product"

## Product Learnings

### ChatGPT-5 Launch
- "Active people on AI corner of Twitter and normies use AI in two extremely different ways"
- Need to build one product for both groups - "not something we have taken seriously enough"
- Values data over anecdotes but: "if the anecdotes and the data disagree, you've got to go look extra hard because the anecdotes are very often right"

### Sora Success Factors
- 30%+ of active users are active creators (vs typical 1% in 90/9/1 rule)
- Low activation energy for creation dramatically increases creator participation
- Video feels "much more real and lifelike" than images - rights holders want different approach
- Kept separate from ChatGPT because ChatGPT is "intensely personal and private"
- Predicts rights holders will shift from "don't use my content" to "why isn't my content in enough videos"

## On Hardware

- Working with Jony Ive on device
- "Quality of thinking on what new hardware can be has been so stagnant"
- Acknowledges "siren call" risk of getting distracted by own hardware
- Believes AI illustrates "possibility of new things" beyond iPhone gravity well
- Must still work across all devices/browsers

### Update: IO Acquisition (May 2025)

OpenAI acquired Jony Ive's device company IO for $6.5B:
- Jony Ive: "this is the best work our team has ever done" (from person who created iPhone and MacBook Pro)
- Plan: AI-powered device family debuting 2026, shipping 100+ million devices
- David Lee calls it a "long-shot bet to kill the iPhone"
- Altman calls Ive "the deepest thinker I've ever met"

## Trust as Competitive Advantage

"There is a reason people love ChatGPT in a way that they don't love other large tech companies' products... even when ChatGPT screws up, hallucinates, whatever, you know it's trying to help you, you know your incentives are aligned."

This trust would "fall precipitously" if they started optimizing for anything other than best answers.

## Hiring Note

Fidji Simo joined as product leader - Altman is "extremely excited" about her hit-creation ability while he focuses on infrastructure deals.

## Meta-Level Observations

### Historical Framing
- Prefers transistor analogy over Windows analogy - AI will "seep everywhere"
- Acknowledges ChatGPT passing "popular conception" of Turing Test despite definitional quibbles

### On Jobs
- "Not worried long-term about AI impact on jobs"
- "We love to do stuff for other people. We love to be recognized and appreciated by other people, and so we'll find things to do to be useful to other people."

### Investment Thesis
- "Given where we are with the research, with our business, with the product... is it the right decision or not? We will find out, but it is the decision we're going to make."
- Says no to "a lot" of product ideas - tries to do "very small number" of things really well
