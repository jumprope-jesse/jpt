# Psychological Boundaries - Natural Limits Between People

## Core Concept

Natural boundaries are the unavoidable separateness between individuals:
- **You can only directly control yourself** - your body, actions, thoughts
- **You cannot directly control others** - their actions, thoughts, feelings
- **You cannot know others' internal states** unless they communicate them
- **Others cannot know your internal states** unless you communicate them

These boundaries always exist. They don't need to be "set" - they need to be **acknowledged**.

## Four Common Boundary Misunderstandings

Between you and another person:

1. **You expect to control someone else** (their thinking, actions, emotions, whether they like you)
2. **You expect someone else can control you**
3. **You expect to know what they're thinking/feeling** without them telling you
4. **You expect they can know your internal state** without you telling them

All of these are failures to acknowledge natural boundaries.

## Why "Setting Boundaries" Language Is Misleading

Traditional "boundary setting" often sounds like:
> "I'm setting a boundary: Don't call me that name!"

**Problem:** This is actually attempting to control someone else's behavior, not respecting boundaries.

**Alternative:** "If you call me that name, I'm going to leave the room."
- This only specifies what YOU will do
- It's a trade the other person can choose to accept or reject
- It respects that you can't unilaterally control their behavior

## Connection to Nonviolent Communication (NVC)

Communication feels "violent" when it fails to acknowledge natural boundaries:
- Attempting to control someone and expecting it to work → feels violent to them
- Telling someone how they're feeling → feels violent to them
- Someone speaks as if they could control you → only feels violent if you unconsciously believe it's possible

NVC tries to explain boundaries, but in an overcomplicated way. The real mechanism for avoiding conflict is **not being too insecure**.

## The Insecurity Connection

**Why understanding boundaries intellectually isn't enough:**

Even if you consciously understand boundaries, you'll fail to respect them when you're insecure.

### Physical Insecurity Example
If you're financially/physically dependent on someone (e.g., living with parents), you might:
- Act as if they can control you (because resisting has real costs)
- Not acknowledge the boundary that you always have choice
- Feel anxiety about their disapproval

The boundary still exists - you could always resist - but the tradeoffs make it not worth it.

### Emotional Insecurity Examples

**Definition:** Unconscious predictions that match: "In order for me to feel the way I want to feel (loved, accepted, etc.), I need others to do certain things or be certain ways."

Common patterns:
- "In order to feel okay, I need others to not be mad at me"
- "The only way I can feel loved is if this particular person loves me"
- Anxiety when someone gets angry at you
- Neediness about getting specific people to like you

**Why insecurities make boundaries hard:**
- If you feel emotionally dependent on others liking you, you'll try to control them into liking you
- If you fear others disliking you, you'll have trouble "setting boundaries" (because that sometimes makes people mad)
- You won't acknowledge boundaries because you need to believe you can control outcomes

## The Real Path to Understanding Boundaries

1. **Become less physically insecure** - Achieve financial/physical independence so one person's disapproval doesn't threaten your survival
2. **Address emotional insecurities** - Unlearn unconscious predictions that you need others to act certain ways for you to feel okay
3. **Then boundaries become trivial** - Once you're not excessively insecure, the concept is obvious and executing it is effortless

You'll naturally:
- Feel no need to control other people
- Not let them control you
- Not expect to know what they're thinking
- Not expect them to know what you're thinking

## Reducing Emotional Insecurity

### Why We Have Emotional Insecurities

They're not inherently bad - they likely kept you alive as a child. A child who depends on parents learns to fear parental disapproval because it could lead to starvation or death.

The problem is carrying these patterns into adulthood when they're no longer necessary.

### Path Forward

1. **Physical independence first** - Once you're financially/physically independent, one person disliking you won't threaten survival
2. **Unlearn unconscious predictions** - The work of actually changing emotional insecurities

Promising approaches:
- **Coherence Therapy** - Addresses root emotional learnings
- **Memory reconsolidation** - Actually changing emotional memories, not just managing them
- **Somatic therapy** - Body-based emotional processing
- **Gendlin's Focusing** - Attending to felt senses to access unconscious knowledge

### Example: Neediness in Romance

Pattern: "I need this specific person to love me to feel loved"

Root cause: Often denial of self-love. When you address self-love, the neediness for that specific person dissolves.

## Practical Implications

**In conflicts:**
- Someone doesn't do what you want → Remember: you can't unilaterally control them
- Someone "makes" you sad → Remember: they didn't reach into your brain; your interpretation of events created the emotion
- Someone tells you how you're feeling → Remember: they literally cannot know your internal state

**In communication:**
- State preferences about others' behavior, but don't expect to fully determine their actions
- Offer trades ("If X, then I'll do Y") rather than demands
- Recognize others always have choice

**When triggered:**
- The trigger reveals an area where you're not fully acknowledging boundaries
- Usually points to an underlying insecurity
- If you deeply understood the boundary, the situation wouldn't feel triggering

## Key Insight

Most social conflicts stem from either:
1. Not acknowledging natural boundaries exist, OR
2. Being too insecure to acknowledge them (because acknowledging them feels threatening)

The solution isn't better "boundary setting techniques" - it's becoming secure enough that acknowledging reality doesn't feel dangerous.
