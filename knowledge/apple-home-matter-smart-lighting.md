# Apple Home & Matter Smart Lighting

*Source: [The Verge - Apple Home brings Adaptive Lighting to Matter](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/8/24215517/ios-18-homekit-adaptive-lighting-matter-smart-bulbs) - Added: 2026-01-18*

## Adaptive Lighting for Matter Devices (iOS 18+)

Starting with iOS 18, Apple Home supports **Adaptive Lighting** for Matter-compatible smart lights. Previously, this feature only worked with native HomeKit devices.

### What Adaptive Lighting Does

Automatically adjusts light color temperature throughout the day:
- **Morning**: Cool, bright light (refreshing, energizing)
- **Evening**: Warm, soft light (cozy, relaxing)
- No manual adjustment needed—set it once and forget

### Why This Matters

Before iOS 18:
- Adaptive Lighting only worked with HomeKit-native products
- Limited to a few brands: Nanoleaf, Philips Hue, Eve, Aqara
- Matter versions of these products lost Adaptive Lighting capability

After iOS 18:
- **All Matter-compatible bulbs** can use Adaptive Lighting through Apple Home
- Brands like Govee, Lifx, Wiz, Linkind now work with the feature
- Wider product selection, more competitive pricing

### First Compatible Products

Nanoleaf Essentials Matter line confirmed:
- A19 bulb
- Light strip

Philips Hue likely to follow (had to downgrade to Matter to lose the feature previously).

### Limitations

- **Apple Home exclusive** - Adaptive Lighting is not part of the Matter spec
- Won't work in Amazon Alexa or Google Home ecosystems
- CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance) has similar advanced lighting on its roadmap for Matter's future

### Matter Overview

Matter is an interoperability standard for smart home devices:
- Developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, Samsung
- Devices communicate locally (no cloud dependency)
- Supports 30+ device types: lighting, thermostats, locks, vacuums, etc.
- Works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and Thread
- Multi-Admin feature allows one device to work with multiple ecosystems

### Practical Implications

For users considering smart lighting:
- **iOS users**: Can now confidently buy Matter bulbs knowing Adaptive Lighting will work
- **Multi-platform households**: May still need Apple Home as the primary controller for this feature
- **Budget-conscious**: More brand options means better prices for Adaptive Lighting-capable setups
