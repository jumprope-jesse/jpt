# Modeling Worldviews: Beyond Left-Right

A framework for understanding political disagreement by modeling worldviews as points in high-dimensional space.

## The Core Problem

We spend more time arguing why we're right than understanding why opponents don't accept our arguments. The "other side" isn't evil - they have a different worldview that leads to different conclusions about what's right.

The left-right binary captures something real but is:
- Woefully inadequate for nuanced prediction
- Under-defined (who is the "true" leftist?)
- Context-dependent and shifts over time
- More about clustering into two groups than identifying interpretable axes

**Evidence of inadequacy:** "Politically homeless" people who feel their party changed while they stood still (classical liberals vs. woke left, never-Trumpers vs. MAGA).

## Worldviews as High-Dimensional Vector Space

**The model:** Each person has a set of values and beliefs (their worldview) that would perfectly predict their position on any issue if fully known.

- Each value/belief = a spectrum (dimension) along which people vary
- All dimensions together = high-dimensional space
- Each worldview = a point in that space
- Similar worldviews = points close together (low Euclidean distance)

**Key insights:**
- Some beliefs are downstream of more fundamental ones
- Some dimensions explain many positions, others few
- Dimensions are correlated but bring independent information

## The Big N Worldview Factors Project

Analogous to how Big 5 personality factors provide a low-dimensional model of personality space, we could seek Big N Worldview factors (N = 2-10).

**Goals:**
- Find axes that describe worldview differences across diverse populations, times, and places
- Map to pre-existing, interpretable concepts (ideology, moral philosophy)
- Select mostly independent factors for parsimony

## Candidate Axes

### 1. Progressivism vs. Conservatism

Both accept that progress is possible and worthy (post-Enlightenment). They disagree on:
- How easy is progress?
- How likely can we predict beneficial changes?

**Conservatives:** Slow, incremental changes to evaluate impact. System is surprisingly functional; progress can be lost and is hard to regain.

**Progressives:** More confident that we can identify and implement improvements.

**Taxonomy:**
- Conservative-progressives (incremental change)
- Radical-progressives (faster change)
- Anti-progressives (trads, "retvrn" - actively reject modern progress)

### 2. Constrained vs. Unconstrained Vision (Thomas Sowell)

From *A Conflict of Visions* - the most powerful lens for understanding political divides.

**Constrained vision:**
- Human selfishness is a given, largely intractable
- Focus on designing systems that produce prosocial outcomes despite flawed nature
- Talk in terms of incentives and trade-offs
- Evils derive from "limited and unhappy choices available"
- Seek causes of peace, wealth, law-abiding society (these are the anomalies)

**Unconstrained vision:**
- Human selfishness is correctable, product of unjust systems
- "Foolish or immoral choices explain evils; wiser policies are the solution"
- Human nature is beneficially changeable
- Social customs are expendable holdovers
- Insensitive to process costs ("every closer approximation to ideal is preferred")
- Seek causes of war, poverty, crime (these need explaining)

**Modern applications:**
- "Get woke" / "do the work" = unconstrained vision (wake sleeping virtues)
- "Toxic masculinity" = unconstrained (aggression is socialized, not tamed by socialization)
- Right-wing conspiracy thinking = also unconstrained (nefarious individuals oppress us)

---

### 3. Rationalism vs. Postmodernism (Epistemological)

**The liberal consensus:** Progressives and conservatives "spoke the same language" - rational argument from observed facts (Enlightenment heritage).

**Recent shift:**
- Left: Postmodern epistemology (woke left)
- Right: Anti-Enlightenment alt-right (conspiracy-minded, nativist)

**The deeper divide:** "Wokism vs. liberalism" - wokism is at odds with BOTH sides of the liberal consensus, not just conservatives.

## Open Questions

1. Are worldviews better understood as:
   - Baskets of beliefs combined in countless ways? OR
   - Branches on a decision tree narrowing possible combinations?

2. How does Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory relate?

3. What axes does the primary axis miss entirely?
