# Shifting Baseline Syndrome and Privacy Erosion

A framework from fisheries science that explains how privacy expectations have gradually eroded without us noticing.

## The Concept

**Shifting baseline syndrome** was identified by Daniel Pauly in 1995 studying fish populations. Each generation of scientists compared current fish populations to what was "normal" when they started their careers—not to historical baselines. This masked exponential decline.

The same phenomenon applies to privacy:
- Each generation accepts the privacy status quo of their youth as "normal"
- What seems acceptable today would have been unthinkable 20 years ago
- The cumulative loss is devastating, but each individual step seems minor

## Key Examples

- **Cloud software model**: Apps went from standalone to always-online, feeding usage data back. We now expect this.
- **Microsoft AI monitoring**: When Microsoft caught hackers using their AI tools, the reaction was "of course they monitor users"—not outrage at surveillance.
- **AI chatbots**: Complex cloud systems track all input. Users accept this because the baseline has already shifted.

## Legal Implications

The US Supreme Court ties privacy rights to "reasonable expectation of privacy." But expectation is subject to shifting baselines—as norms change, legal protections erode.

## What To Do

The fisheries solution: Stop using relative measures (this decade vs. last decade). Instead:
1. Define what a healthy ecosystem should look like holistically
2. Set scientifically-derived sustainable limits
3. Codify through regulation

For privacy: Define what a healthy technological ecosystem looks like—one that respects privacy while allowing sustainable business models—then regulate to that standard.
