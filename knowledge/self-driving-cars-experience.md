## Waymo Experience Report (Matt Bell, 130 Hours)

### The Upgrade

After 130 hours in Waymos, Matt Bell reports it's a huge upgrade:
- Time in car becomes time in a mobile mini-office
- Not zero commute time, but much less expensive lost time
- Everything is super predictable
- Much safer than human drivers

### The Catch: Predictability Gets Exploited

People are figuring out Waymos are incredibly docile:

> "I once had someone sit on my Waymo for a few minutes to prevent it from moving. Waymos are programmed to be very cautious and careful drivers. They are completely unable to deal with someone sitting on the car's hood."

**Any person on the street can indefinitely stall a Waymo.** This is a sign of a new behavioral dynamic that will become more prevalent with time.

### Why This Happens (Paul Crowley's Point)

Our social equilibria rely on human unpredictability and the low possibility of completely unhinged responses. You don't know what might trigger an oversized reaction.

We don't want—and won't tolerate—AI or self-driving cars having that tiny chance of going bonkers. So they become predictable. And predictable systems get exploited.

## Deployment Scale (November 2024)

### Current Numbers

Waymo is doubling ride numbers approximately every three months.

### Scale Context

- Americans make ~3-4 billion car trips per week
- Taxis and rideshares are probably ~100-200 million of those
- At current growth rate (doubling every ~3 months):
  - ~5 million weekly trips by end of 2025
  - Half the taxi industry by end of 2026

### State Authorization Map

States vary in how much they've authorized autonomous vehicle testing/operation:
- Some states have explicitly enacted laws/EOs/regulations allowing AVs
- Some haven't explicitly said either way
- Grey states = no explicit prohibition or authorization

## Trump Administration Policy Direction

Trump's transition team plans federal rules enabling self-driving cars.

**Common framing:** "Giveaway to Elon Musk" or "dystopian nightmare"

**Alternative framing:** Enabling the future. Self-driving cars are especially wonderful for the blind and others who cannot drive.

**Key policy point:** If people want vehicles to have steering wheels, gas pedals, and manual overrides, the market will provide those things. If not, not.

## Benefits Beyond Convenience

### Accessibility

In contexts where leftists would embrace accommodations, opponents of self-driving cars ignore this aspect as inconvenient:
- Huge value for blind people
- Huge value for others who cannot drive
- Not just accommodation but pure improvement

### Mobile Office

The transformation of commute time into productive time is the killer feature for knowledge workers.

## The Behavioral Challenge

The fundamental tension:
- Safety requires predictability
- Predictability enables exploitation
- Humans rely on unpredictability for social equilibrium

This is an unsolved problem in autonomous systems.
