# Selective Agency

The concept that people are not uniformly high-agency or low-agency across their lives, but rather selectively agentic - stuck at earlier developmental stages in certain areas while thriving in others.

## Core Insight

When you first encounter a problem and fail to solve it, your approach becomes "frozen in time" at whatever capacity you had then. You never revisit whether your increased capabilities might now allow new solutions.

**Example:** Someone who tried therapy at 20 for anxiety, found it didn't work, and now at 32 (as a capable CTO) still treats anxiety as a fixed trait - never applying the same resourcefulness they'd use to solve work problems.

## The Three Theaters of Life

1. **Work** - Professional achievements and problem-solving
2. **Relationships** - Connections with others (all kinds)
3. **Self-relationship** - Physical health, introspection, emotional development

Most people are "Actually Trying" in only one or two of these domains.

## Signs You're Not Actually Trying

- **Struggling feels like evidence of effort** - But continuous need for willpower may signal a badly-engineered approach
- **Problems feel like fixed traits** - Friends playfully rib you about them, reinforcing the identity
- **First solution didn't work, so you gave up** - Never revisited with your current (higher) capacity
- **You wouldn't accept this from a friend** - If someone came to you with the same problem, you'd generate many more options

## Faulty Sensory Appreciation

From Alexander Technique: habitual tension distorts sensory impressions. Rigid stillness via bodily tension *feels like* good posture, while relaxed uprightness feels wrong.

**Applied to agency:** The strain of low-agency approaches feels like correctness, like you're trying hard. But struggling is not evidence you've tried everything.

## The Diagnostic Questions

1. Have I done my best to come up with potential solutions, using ALL resources I have?
2. Am I doing as well by myself as I would by any friend who came to me with the same problem?
3. How do I KNOW I'm Actually Trying?

## What Actually Trying Looks Like (Example: Anxiety)

Instead of accepting it as a trait, you could:
- Check nutrition and sleep seriously
- Research supplements and medication
- Invest resources in rest and recovery
- Ask all friends about best treatments/coaches/therapists they've encountered
- Research emerging therapies designed for people like you

## Connection to Other Ideas

- Complements the [Learning Hard Things Framework](learning-hard-things-framework.md) - that's about *how* to learn, this is about identifying *where* you're not applying yourself
- Related to the "founder mindset" applied to personal life
- Counter to learned helplessness
