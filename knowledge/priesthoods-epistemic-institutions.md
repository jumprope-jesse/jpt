# Priesthoods and Epistemic Institutions

Source: Scott Alexander, "On Priesthoods" - Astral Codex Ten (Jan 2025)

## Core Thesis

Priesthoods (medicine, academia, journalism, etc.) are not just collections of experts but a specific *institutional structure* that serves epistemic functions. The structure itself - not just the expertise of members - produces value through:

1. **Smart-people-only discussion** with high signal-to-noise ratio
2. **Enforceable discussion norms** (can expel bad actors)
3. **Consensus production** that the public can actually use
4. **Reputation systems** that make priests sensitive to peer judgment

## Why Priesthoods Have Hard Boundaries

### Against the Public
- Entire identity comes from separation from public
- Ideas similar to public's get actively penalized
- Example: Dr. Oz - skilled Columbia surgeon who lost all status by "catering to the public"
- GMU economists are great bloggers but that doesn't raise their academic status
- "Only your reputation within the priesthood matters"

### Against Capitalism
- Mercenary behavior loses status (concierge medicine historically suspect)
- By end of training, all status sources replaced by priesthood approval
- Pharma companies gain access by sacrificing capitalist parts (heavy regulation, journal publications)

### Ritualized Communication
- Twitter replies: insults, anecdotes, bad statistics, manifestos, spam
- Journal communication: bloodless, controlled, sorted by importance
- Ritualization enables consensus and filters noise

## Why Priesthoods Fail

**Monoculture problem**: Same personality types, isolated from outside, perfect environment for memetic plagues.

**Protections in specialty**: Smart in their area, forced contact with reality, academic politics incentivizes disagreement.

**Vulnerable outside specialty**: Less competent, fewer protections, barely worth capturing.

**Historical failures**:
- 1950s psychology (psychoanalysis, behaviorism) - wronger than the public
- Anthropology/sociology turning 100% Marxist
- Modern architecture producing buildings nobody wants
- Academic musicology producing atonal music nobody enjoys

**The wokeness capture** (Alexander's theory):
- Priesthoods have tension between "contempt for public" and "wanting to be in-touch"
- Wokeness resolves this beautifully: the public (straight white males) is the enemy of in-touch-ness
- Learning correct pronouns = secret knowledge that makes you cool
- You can even call Latinos "Latinx" (which they hate) and be *more* in-touch than them
- Once boundary between priesthood and politics demolished, "sordid outside world came rushing through"

## Why Priesthoods Still Matter

### Priest lies vs. non-priest lies

**Priest lies are**:
- Subtle and elegant (buried in footnotes)
- Limited by reputation concerns
- Policed by other priests wanting to maintain priesthood status
- Correlated (all priests vulnerable to same fads)

**Non-priest lies are**:
- Blatant and stupid
- Unlimited (no reputation to protect)
- No enforcement mechanism
- Uncorrelated (random chaos)

### The tradeoff

| Dimension | Priests | Non-Priests |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Per-claim accuracy | Higher | Lower |
| Error correlation | High (same biases) | Low (random) |
| Failure mode | Totalitarian hellhole | Hippopotamus-eye medicine |

"Even though on every specific point you'll probably do better trusting the priests, a blanket policy of always trusting the priests may not be in your interests."

## Open Questions (from Alexander)

1. How broken are priesthoods?
2. Fix them or replicate their function differently?
3. How would we even do either?
4. When to trust priests (subtle mistruths, limited damage) vs. non-priests (uncorrelated failure modes)?

## Connection to Other Ideas

**Bounded Distrust**: Alexander's prior writing on why complete distrust of institutions is wrong.

**The Media Very Rarely Lies**: Related piece on how media deceives through selection/framing, not fabrication.

**Relates to**: Institutional destruction analysis - priesthoods are exactly the expertise being dismantled in current political moment.

## Relevance

### For Epistemics
- Understanding why "do your own research" often fails
- Why alternative media is hit-or-miss (good ones often run by defrocked priests)
- Why consensus production is valuable even when imperfect

### For AI/Tech
- AI assistants face similar questions: how to balance "helpful" with "authoritative"
- LLMs trained on priesthood outputs inherit their biases
- Alternative: LLMs that can synthesize across uncorrelated sources?

### For Personal Knowledge Work
- Building personal knowledge base is like creating mini-priesthood of one
- Need both priest-like rigor and outsider-like independence
- Cross-reference multiple priesthoods to decorrelate errors

## Empirical Data: Bipartisan Trust Collapse (Dec 2024)

Source: Kristen Soltis Anderson (Republican pollster), NYT Opinion, Dec 31, 2024

### Key Polling Data

**Institutional Trust Convergence** - Left and Right now equally distrust:

| Institution | Trend | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| Big Business | R trust dropped 20pts since 2012 | Rs caught up to Ds in disdain |
| Military | R confidence dropped 23pts since 2020 | Partisan gap nearly closed |
| News Media | D trust dropped 18pts since 2017 | Rs bottomed out, Ds catching up |
| Higher Ed | R trust cratered to 20% | Was 57% bipartisan <decade ago |
| Democracy itself | Only 17% R / 38% D "satisfied" | Dreadfully low, bipartisan |

**The PwC Trust Gap**: 90% of executives think customers trust them "a lot" vs. only 30% of customers who agree. Leaders consistently surprised by public skepticism.

### 2024 Election as Depolarization Event

Contrary to expectations, gaps shrank:
- Gender gap: -3 points vs. predicted historic high
- Age gap (under 30 vs over 65): From ~30pts apart to ~12pts
- Racial polarization: Nonwhite voters shifted 12+ pts toward Trump

### What's Driving This

1. **Information ecosystem** - Transparency hasn't increased trust, failures go viral
2. **Interpersonal trust decline** - Lowest among young, nonwhite, less educated (overlaps with Trump 2024 gains)
3. **Cumulative effect** - "Distrust can go viral" across unrelated institutions

### Anderson's Conclusion

"There is an opportunity here: The bipartisan anger is real and could be harnessed for bold action."

But warns: "Voters are looking for things to be fixed, not obliterated." Institutions must "deliver on their promise" not just be demolished.

### Connection to Priesthood Framework

This data supports Alexander's analysis: priesthoods are failing not just on the right (historical distrust) but increasingly on the left (the newer development). The "wokeness capture" theory explains why left-coded institutions lost *both* sides - they alienated conservatives while eventually disappointing progressives too.

Key insight: Trust collapse is **correlated** across institutions - when one priesthood fails visibly, others get tarred. This is the "memetic plague" Alexander warned about.

## The Postmodern Right: Parallel Epistemics Across the Political Spectrum

Source: Regan Arntz-Gray, "Has the right gone woke?" - All Cats Are Female (Nov 2024)

### Core Thesis

The term "woke right" is controversial but draws a legitimate parallel at the **epistemological level** - not object-level beliefs, but how evidence is evaluated and truth-claims are legitimated.

### Wokism vs. Liberal Progressivism

From the right's perspective, woke beliefs appear as mere extensions of standard progressive ideas. But Arntz-Gray (and Rick, whose analysis she cites) argue wokism marks a **postmodern epistemological break** from classic liberalism:

> "Woke intolerance is rooted in a postmodern tendency to attack the legitimacy of their critics as interlocutors rather than addressing the substance of the criticism. Of course, when there is no objective reality to adjudicate disagreements, and all that's left is power relations, why privilege evidence and data?"

The move: systemic forces bias all empirical evidence → nothing can really be trusted → anyone with power is suspect.

### The Postmodern Pattern

**Both postmodern left and right share:**
1. Deep cynicism about whether powerful institutions allow truth to surface
2. Evidence that contradicts their views dismissed as manufactured by the powerful
3. Unfalsifiable claims (any counterevidence proves the conspiracy)
4. Resentment politics and self-victimization

**Where they differ:**

| Dimension | Postmodern Left | Postmodern Right |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| The enemy | Vague systemic forces (patriarchy, systemic racism, corporate interests) | Specific groups of evil elites (WEF, globalists, often ending at Jews) |
| Distribution focus | The most vulnerable (victims of oppression/marginalization) | The median person (how normal people are victimized) |
| Temporal orientation | Revolutionary - build something wholly new | Restorationist - return to what we lost |
| Moral framing | Secular Christianity minus supernatural - meek must inherit earth NOW | The weak victimize the strong; "superior" people held back |

### Example: Covid Vaccine Skepticism

Starting point: Public health authorities made real mistakes and even obscured truth (e.g., masks don't work while hospitals need them).

Postmodern move: Catastrophize from reasonable observation → nothing they said can be trusted → vaccines probably dangerous → maybe the whole thing was a plandemic.

The same pattern applies to inflation data, election integrity, and any domain where authorities have demonstrably erred.

### The Christian Root (Secularized)

Arntz-Gray traces the left's focus on the vulnerable to Christian concern for the downtrodden. But with supernatural elements removed:
- No afterlife where wrongs are righted
- "Turn the other cheek" becomes enabling evil
- Moral superiority of the oppressed maintained
- The meek must inherit the earth **in the here and now**
- Any means necessary (including violence as "resistance")

### The Liberal Alternative

> "Those of us who hold liberal values, who believe that knowledge really can be evaluated rationally and empirically, and that progress can be made, whether we lean cognitively more conservative or progressive, do in many ways have a common enemy."

The postmodern turn - whether left or right - represents a departure from Enlightenment epistemics that classical liberals and traditional conservatives can jointly oppose.

### Connection to Priesthood Framework

This analysis complements Alexander's priesthood model:

- **Priesthoods** represent Enlightenment epistemics (flawed but correctable through peer review, evidence, etc.)
- **Postmodern left** attacks priesthoods as power structures that legitimize oppression
- **Postmodern right** attacks priesthoods as "the Cathedral" manufacturing consent for globalist elites
- Both reject the premise that priesthoods, despite flaws, produce better beliefs than alternatives

The "memetic plague" Alexander describes may be the postmodern epistemics itself spreading across the political spectrum - once you accept that power corrupts all evidence, you've exited the liberal epistemic framework entirely.
