# Learning Hard Things Framework

A systematic approach to skill acquisition, based on David R. MacIver's "Fully General System For Learning To Do Hard Things."

## The Core Principle

This system works because it provides direct feedback loops. By isolating one aspect of difficulty at a time, you:
- Improve rapidly on that specific aspect
- Get clear signal when you fail (no complicated root cause analysis)
- Hit the limits of your ability faster (and can then address those limits)

**Key insight:** When practicing something difficult in multiple ways simultaneously, you'll be worse at *all* of them than if you'd practiced each one separately.

## The Single-Loop System

Use when you **know what success looks like** but can't achieve it yet.

1. Find something **like** the hard thing but **easy**
2. Modify the easy thing to be hard in **exactly one way**
3. Practice until that one aspect is no longer hard
4. If stuck:
   - Go back to step 2 and add a different hard aspect
   - OR modify the current task to isolate difficulty differently
   - OR do the same task in a new context
5. If the original hard thing is now easy → done. Otherwise → step 2

## The Double-Loop System

Use when you **don't know what success looks like** (need to develop taste).

1. Apply single-loop to **understanding the problem space**
   - Consume examples, learn to distinguish good from bad
   - Build your sense of good taste
2. Apply single-loop to **doing well by your own standards**
3. Get external feedback
   - If others agree it's good → you've learned the skill
   - If not: either improve your taste OR convince them (both are valid)

## Identifying Points of Difficulty

When it's not obvious what to work on:

- **Self-assessment:** Try the hard thing, note what you did badly or struggled with
- **Try beginner exercises:** Observe which ones are hard for you
- **Ask an expert/teacher:** They can spot gaps you can't see
- **Work backwards:** Start with the hard thing, remove one hard aspect at a time until it becomes easy

## Worked Example: Learning to Write

**Common difficulties (roughly in order to tackle):**

1. **Physical mechanics** → Learn to touch type first
2. **Finding voice** → Practice speaking-to-writing (record yourself talking, transcribe)
3. **Starting** (perfectionism, fear, uncertainty) → Write privately with zero quality expectations
4. **Editing & structure** → Set specific editing goals, work on one at a time

**The key:** You CAN write. You can write a tweet. Everything harder is incremental steps from there.

## Important Caveats

**This is not a shortcut.** It's a lot of work. The goal is to ensure work you do is useful.

**"Eventually" is unhelpful.** You will either:
- Succeed relatively quickly
- Get bored and give up
- Discover the goal is impossible for you

**But that's OK:** The system provides benefit at every step, even if you don't reach the final goal.

## Applications

This framework applies to:
- **Programming:** Break complex projects into single-hard-aspect exercises
- **Parenting:** Isolate specific challenges (communication, problem-solving) to improve
- **Writing:** Separate mechanics, voice, fear, and editing
- **Any skill:** The system is "fully general"

## Connection to Other Ideas

- Relates to deliberate practice (Ericsson)
- Echoes the debugging mindset of "isolate the variable"
- Counter to the intuitive "just practice the hard thing" approach
