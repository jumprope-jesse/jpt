# Learning Hard Things Framework

A systematic approach to skill acquisition, based on David R. MacIver's "Fully General System For Learning To Do Hard Things."

*Source: https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/ - Added: 2026-01-18*

---

## The Core Principle

This system works because it provides direct feedback loops. By isolating one aspect of difficulty at a time, you:
- Improve rapidly on that specific aspect
- Get clear signal when you fail (no complicated root cause analysis)
- Hit the limits of your ability faster (and can then address those limits)

**Key insight:** When practicing something difficult in multiple ways simultaneously, you'll be worse at *all* of them than if you'd practiced each one separately.

---

## The Single-Loop System

Use when you **know what success looks like** but can't achieve it yet.

1. Find something **like** the hard thing but **easy**
2. Modify the easy thing to be hard in **exactly one way**
3. Practice until that one aspect is no longer hard
4. If stuck:
   - Go back to step 2 and add a different hard aspect
   - OR modify the current task to isolate difficulty differently
   - OR do the same task in a new context
5. If the original hard thing is now easy → done. Otherwise → step 2

---

## The Double-Loop System

Use when you **don't know what success looks like** (need to develop taste).

1. Apply single-loop to **understanding the problem space**
   - Consume examples, learn to distinguish good from bad
   - Build your sense of good taste
2. Apply single-loop to **doing well by your own standards**
3. Get external feedback
   - If others agree it's good → you've learned the skill
   - If not: either improve your taste OR convince them (both are valid)

---

## Identifying Points of Difficulty

When it's not obvious what to work on:

- **Self-assessment:** Try the hard thing, note what you did badly or struggled with
- **Try beginner exercises:** Observe which ones are hard for you
- **Ask an expert/teacher:** They can spot gaps you can't see
- **Work backwards:** Start with the hard thing, remove one hard aspect at a time until it becomes easy

---

## Worked Example: Learning to Write

**Common difficulties (roughly in order to tackle):**

1. **Physical mechanics** → Learn to touch type first
2. **Finding voice** → Practice speaking-to-writing (record yourself talking, transcribe)
3. **Starting** (perfectionism, fear, uncertainty) → Write privately with zero quality expectations
4. **Editing & structure** → Set specific editing goals, work on one at a time

**The key:** You CAN write. You can write a tweet. Everything harder is incremental steps from there.

---

## Important Caveats

**This is not a shortcut.** It's a lot of work. The goal is to ensure work you do is useful.

**"Eventually" is unhelpful.** You will either:
- Succeed relatively quickly
- Get bored and give up
- Discover the goal is impossible for you

**But that's OK:** The system provides benefit at every step, even if you don't reach the final goal.

---

## Applications

This framework applies to:
- **Programming:** Break complex projects into single-hard-aspect exercises
- **Parenting:** Isolate specific challenges (communication, problem-solving) to improve
- **Writing:** Separate mechanics, voice, fear, and editing
- **Any skill:** The system is "fully general"

---

## Connection to Other Ideas

- Relates to deliberate practice (Ericsson)
- Echoes the debugging mindset of "isolate the variable"
- Counter to the intuitive "just practice the hard thing" approach

## Karpathy's Education Philosophy: Eureka Labs & the Perfect Tutor

*Source: [Andrej Karpathy - AGI is still a decade away](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy) - Added: 2026-01-18*

Karpathy is building "Starfleet Academy" - an elite institution for technical knowledge, with both physical and digital components.

### The Perfect Tutor Experience

From learning Korean with a one-on-one tutor:

> "I felt like I was the only constraint to learning. I was always given the perfect information."

What a great tutor does:
- **Instant assessment** - understands where you are from a short conversation
- **Probes precisely** - asks exactly the right questions to understand your world model
- **Serves the right material** - always appropriately challenging, never too hard or too trivial
- **You become the only bottleneck** - no hunting for knowledge, no poor explanations

**Current LLMs can't do this.** "No LLM will do that for you 100% right now, not even close."

### Why ChatGPT-Based Learning is "Slop"

- If you ask ChatGPT "teach me AI," you get slop
- AI can never write something like micrograd or nanochat - the teaching artifacts that matter
- For what Karpathy has in mind, "it's not yet the time"

### Teaching Well: First-Order Thinking

From physics training: find the first-order terms, add second-order later.

**micrograd example:**
- 100 lines of Python that shows backpropagation
- Everything you need to understand neural network training
- Everything else (tensors, kernels, memory orchestration) is "just efficiency"

> "The core intellectual piece of neural network training is micrograd. It's 100 lines."

### The Pain-Before-Solution Pattern

> "You want to take the student through that progression."

- Present the pain before you present a solution
- Always prompt the student to guess before revealing
- "How would you solve this? I'm not going to present the solution before you guess."
- Not letting them try first is "a dick move"

### Why Experts Are Bad Explainers

**Curse of knowledge:** Take things for granted, can't put yourself in beginner's shoes.

**Karpathy's fix:** Ask people to share their "dumb ChatGPT conversations" about his material. Helps him see beginner perspective again.

### The Beer Talk vs Paper Gap

> "You didn't have to read the paper."

At conferences, authors explain papers perfectly in three sentences over beers - but the paper itself is impenetrable. "Why isn't that the abstract?"

**Dwarkesh's insight:** Narration/transcription of how someone would explain something over lunch is always more accurate and understandable than their written version.

### Post-AGI Education: Like Going to the Gym

Pre-AGI: Education is useful (make money)
Post-AGI: Education is fun (self-improvement)

> "You'll go to school like you go to the gym."

People go to gym not because society needs their physical strength (machines do that), but because:
- It's fun
- It's healthy
- You look hot with a six-pack

Education will be the same. If learning is trivially easy (perfect AI tutor), people will do it for the same reasons they work out.

### "Eurekas Per Second"

Karpathy's metric for educational quality: **eurekas per second** (understanding per second).

nanochat is a ramp to knowledge - if you give this artifact to someone and they look through it, they're getting lots of eurekas.

### The Technical Problem of Education

> "Education is the very difficult technical process of building ramps to knowledge."

This is engineering work, not just "diffusing knowledge." Creating simplified artifacts (micrograd, nanochat) that give maximum understanding per fact added.

### Human Potential is Barely Scratched

> "I feel that the geniuses of today are barely scratching the surface of what a human mind can do."

With perfect AI tutors:
- Anyone could speak five languages
- Anyone could know basic undergrad curriculum
- Not because of less human limitation, but because current education is so broken

Learning is currently hard because material is too easy or too hard - people bounce off. Perfect personalization removes this barrier.

## Practice Surface Area: Turning Life Into Training

*Source: [Increasing your practice surface area - Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/lifestyle/increasing-your-practice-surface-area-agxYGi9bL0gd1WYYQZAu) - Added: 2026-01-18*

**Practice surface area** = the total volume of time and space in your life where practice can happen.

### The Hidden Rep Phenomenon

When two people follow the same formal training but one improves dramatically faster, we often chalk it up to "talent." But the real difference is often practice surface area - the faster learner has dissolved the boundaries of what counts as practice.

**The comparison:** You and a friend both "practice 3 hours per week," but they actually put in 30. They weren't even aware they were doing it.

- They started hearing music differently
- Every song on the commute became a lesson in chord progressions
- Fingers unconsciously worked through scales during meetings
- They fell asleep running through the next day's session

**The insight:** You began practicing guitar. They began *living* guitar.

### Examples From Elite Performers

**George Orwell** - hated the physical act of writing, but for 15 years carried out a "literary exercise" of narrating his life in his head:

> "For minutes at a time this kind of thing would be running through my head: 'He pushed the door open and entered the room. A yellow beam of sunlight, filtering through the muslin curtains, slanted on to the table...'"

**Richard Feynman** - became a legendary teacher by explaining physics to imaginary students while walking around campus, turning solitude into teaching rehearsal.

**Bobby Fischer** - carried a pocket chess set everywhere, analyzed positions using ceiling tiles as boards while lying in bed. Insomnia became chess study.

**Sofia Polgar** - found crying on the bathroom floor past 1am with a chessboard on her knees: "Daddy, they won't leave me alone!" She went on to achieve one of the highest chess ratings in history.

**Eminem** - can't turn off the part of his brain that rhymes everything. Every conversation becomes inadvertent freestyle practice.

### How to Increase Your Surface Area (Without Obsession)

**1. Find the "minimum viable repetition"**
Identify the smallest possible practice unit that requires no equipment, setup, or specific location. Like Fischer analyzing positions on ceiling tiles.

**2. Turn idle time into mental rehearsal**
Waiting periods and dead time become visualization sessions. Michael Phelps ran "mental movies" of perfect races in waiting rooms and before sleep.

**3. Embed practice into routine activities**
Maya Angelou composed entire poems while mopping floors, using the rhythm of physical work as a metronome for her words.

**4. Create background processing systems**
Develop automatic mental habits that keep your craft running in the background of consciousness throughout the day.

**5. Use environmental constraints as creative parameters**
Anderson Silva practiced striking combinations disguised as dancing at Brazilian clubs - throwing actual combat sequences to the rhythm.

### Connection to Isolation Framework

This complements the "isolate one difficulty" approach:

- **Isolation** = structured practice sessions with deliberate difficulty targeting
- **Surface area** = informal practice woven throughout daily life

Both matter. Isolation makes formal practice efficient; surface area multiplies total practice time without feeling like work.

### Practical Applications

- **Commutes** → Mental rehearsal, problem-solving, background processing
- **Waiting rooms** → Visualization, minimum viable reps
- **Physical activities** → Embed related skills (rhythm, sequences, patterns)
- **Idle moments** → Keep the craft running in background consciousness
- **Family time** → Involve kids in skill-related activities (learning + bonding)

## Sal Khan on AI in Education

*Source: [The Verge Decoder Podcast](https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/766082/khan-academy-ceo-sal-khan-ai-education-schoolhouse-hank-green-interview) - Added: 2026-01-18*

Khan Academy's founder on why AI will enhance rather than destroy education:

### Key Positions

**AI as Enhancement, Not Replacement:**
- AI can personalize learning experiences at scale
- Addresses learning gaps that traditional education misses
- Makes education more accessible (geography, economics, disabilities)

**Optimistic Framing:**
- Views AI tutoring as the "2 sigma problem" solution (Bloom's finding that 1-on-1 tutoring produces 2 standard deviation improvement)
- Khan Academy's Khanmigo built on GPT-4 for personalized Socratic tutoring
- Emphasizes AI as tool to augment teachers, not replace them

### Counterarguments to Consider

- Over-reliance on AI could diminish critical thinking and interpersonal skills
- Risk of homogenized learning if AI optimizes for narrow metrics
- Digital divide could widen if AI tutoring becomes premium feature
- Assessment integrity challenges (how do we know what a student actually learned vs what AI helped with?)

### Connection to Karpathy's Views

Both agree on the transformative potential of AI tutoring, but with different emphases:

| Aspect | Karpathy | Khan |
|--------|----------|------|
| Current state | "LLMs can't do it yet, not even close" | Building Khanmigo now, cautiously optimistic |
| Focus | "Eurekas per second" - maximum understanding transfer | Accessibility and personalization at scale |
| Teacher role | AI creates teaching artifacts (micrograd) | AI augments human teachers |
| Timeline | "Not yet the time" for pure AI teaching | Already deploying in classrooms |

**Synthesis:** Both see AI as enabling the "perfect tutor" experience - always appropriately challenging, instantly adaptive. Khan is more bullish on current capabilities; Karpathy sees fundamental limitations in today's LLMs for deep teaching.

## The Skeptical View: Why AI Erodes Learning

*Source: [What A.I. Really Means for Learning - NYT Opinion](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/opinion/ai-college-classrooms-chatgpt.html) - Added: 2026-01-18*

A conversation between sociologist Tressie McMillan Cottom and writer Jessica Grose offers a skeptical counterpoint to AI education optimism. Both rated AI in higher education a "2 out of 10."

### "Mid Tech" - Why AI Isn't Novel

McMillan Cottom argues AI is overhyped compared to its actual utility:

> "AI is not that novel. It is not that potentially revolutionary. It is in a long continuum of technologies that promise to transform education, starting with the TV, the typewriter, VCRs, tablets."

The hype follows a familiar pattern:
- Promise of transformation if we don't "fall behind"
- Pushed into schools without connection to learning outcomes
- No assessment of risks to privacy, data, cognitive development

**Why "mid"?** AI literally averages midlevel responses - and its impact on social processes like learning is similarly mid.

### Learning Is Relational

McMillan Cottom's key insight on why AI differs dangerously from SparkNotes:

> "Learning is fundamentally a social process. It is relational. It happens within the context of relationships."

**The SparkNotes difference:**
- SparkNotes was physical media - you *knew* it wasn't a relationship
- AI delivers summaries in a way that *feels* relational
- Your brain doesn't distinguish computer voice from human voice well
- AI hasn't *earned* the trust we give human beings for information

> "AI doesn't deserve the trust that we give human beings... In fact, it can't earn that trust because it's not human."

### What AI Strips Away

AI automation of learning removes the foundation of learning itself:

> "The challenge is that AI hollows out the foundation of learning because it strips you, gets rid of the mistakes, it gets rid of the opportunities for serendipity."

The emotional feedback loops - pride, frustration, risk, failure - are **part of the learning process**, not obstacles to it:

> "Our poverty of imagination about the human spirit here really gets me down."

### The Responsibility Problem

McMillan Cottom asks a critical question:

> "Who's responsible when AI is wrong? And what responsibility do we have for putting something into the system that has a vast amount of complicated outcomes?"

Her finding: AI is the most **opaque** ed tech innovation yet, shifting risk onto vulnerable students with no clear recourse when things go wrong.

### What Professors Are Actually Doing

Grose found professors adapting positively:

**Community-based learning:**
- Teaching novels by having students run discussions at libraries, schools, senior centers
- Students practice, role-play, then reflect on new skills
- Rebuilding community trust in higher education

**Student-led ethics:**
- Instead of banning AI, professors have students create their own code of conduct
- Students discuss appropriate vs. inappropriate uses and agree collectively
- Professors don't want to be "cops" - transparency beats enforcement

**Post-Covid rebuilding:**
- Students lost socialization years
- Critical thinking, writing, public speaking, community interaction - all skills to rebuild
- AI-free activities serve both learning and social development

### The LinkedIn Horror Story

McMillan Cottom on how technology shapes student anxiety:

> "About four years ago, all of my incoming students started reporting that they've had a LinkedIn account since they were in middle school. I was horrified."

Students arrive having managed "professional profiles" since age 13. Technology use is driven by fear, not positive emotions.

### Why "Just Don't Use It" Fails

> "Kids aren't supposed to have that much willpower. Putting this down to, 'Well, if you don't want to use AI, don't use it' is shifting the responsibility to the exact wrong place."

AI is designed to be used. Adults/society must set guardrails - expecting children to resist sophisticated, research-informed platforms is unreasonable.

### What Would Improve AI in Education?

Both agreed: **regulation**. Any regulation at all.

McMillan Cottom:
> "I'd inch up to a three, maybe a four, if what we were talking about here is building some system of regulation and oversight that did weigh the risks against the possible rewards."

Grose:
- Child-first educational AI built specifically with young people's needs
- Research proving it actually works before deployment
- Currently: "speed of adoption is prioritized rather than finding out if it actually works"

### The Bots-Talking-to-Bots Problem

Grose describes the logical endpoint:

> "In some situations you are having students use ChatGPT to write the paper. They're then handing it in to a professor who is using AI to grade the paper. And it's like, what are we even doing here anymore?"

### Comparison Table: AI Education Perspectives

| Aspect | Khan (Optimist) | Karpathy (Realistic) | McMillan Cottom (Skeptic) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Current AI capability | Building Khanmigo now | "Not even close" | "Mid tech" |
| Historical context | Breakthrough tool | One step in long journey | Same as TV, VCRs, tablets |
| Key risk | Digital divide | LLM limitations | Erodes relational learning |
| Learning is... | Personalization problem | Engineering problem | Social/emotional process |
| Teacher role | Augmented by AI | Creates artifacts (micrograd) | More necessary, not less |
| What's needed | Scale accessibility | Better teaching materials | Democratic oversight |
| On regulation | Cautious optimism | (Not addressed) | Essential, non-negotiable |

### Key Takeaways for Parents and Educators

1. **AI feels relational but isn't** - Be aware of how AI mimics trusted human communication
2. **Learning includes struggle** - Mistakes, serendipity, emotional feedback are features, not bugs
3. **Community rebuilding matters** - Post-Covid students need social skill development alongside academics
4. **Student ethics conversations** - Let students develop their own AI codes of conduct
5. **Guardrails are adult responsibility** - Don't expect kids to resist sophisticated platforms designed to be used
6. **Ask: who's responsible?** - If you can't answer who's accountable when AI fails, that's a problem

## How to Read Business Books Strategically

*Source: [Should You Read Business Books?](https://www.jjude.com/read-biz-books/) - Added: 2026-01-18*

Joseph Jude's framework for getting value from business books without wasting time on hype.

### The Knowledge Hierarchy

Business books can contribute to growth, but only as one input among many:

- **Knowledge** comes from reading (vocabulary, frameworks, mental models)
- **Insight** develops through synthesizing across multiple sources
- **Discernment** requires real-world application, failure, and reflection

This cycle repeats rather than progressing linearly. Reading alone never produces wisdom.

### Practical Recommendations

**1. Recognize author bias**
Every book is "a map" emphasizing certain aspects while omitting others. No single perspective is complete.

**2. Wait for time-tested books**
Skip recent releases; prioritize works still discussed after 5+ years. Hype fades; substance endures.

**3. Read slowly and wrestle**
Engage deeply with ideas rather than speed-reading for status. The goal is transformation, not completion.

**4. Supplement with lived experience**
Communities, annual letters (Buffett, Bezos), and direct conversations matter more than books alone.

**5. Learn from practitioners**
Seek wisdom from those actively doing the work, not distant observers or academics theorizing.

### Why Business Books Get a Bad Rap

Business books prioritize accessibility through stories and case studies. This can feel superficial compared to academic rigor, but serves a pedagogical purpose. The problem isn't the format—it's reading for social performance rather than genuine education.

### Connection to Other Ideas

- **Practice Surface Area**: Reading should feed into applied practice, not replace it
- **Isolation Framework**: Use books to learn one concept at a time, then apply
- **Karpathy's First-Order Thinking**: Look for the core insight (micrograd-style), ignore the fluff

## "Take the Pedals Off" - Isolation in Practice

*Source: [Fortress of Doors](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/take-the-pedals-off-the-bike/) - Added: 2026-01-18*

A vivid practical example of the isolation principle applied to teaching kids to ride bikes.

### The Traditional Method (Fails)

- Kid sits on seat, parent holds handlebars, runs alongside
- Parent releases, kid panics, freezes, topples over
- Repeat 30+ times until it "magically clicks"
- High cost: time, skinned knees, tears, frustration

### The Better Method

**Take the pedals off the bike.**

1. Kid straddles pedal-free bike with feet touching ground
2. Kid runs the bike forward (propelling with feet)
3. Once moving fast enough, kid lifts legs and coasts
4. First: half a second. Then 1 second, 2 seconds, then a whole block
5. Once coasting is reliable, put pedals back on
6. Pedaling comes quickly

### Why It Works

Bicycles balance through the **gyroscopic effect** - faster wheels = more stability. This is deeply counterintuitive to kids:

- Slowing down *feels* safe
- Going fast *feels* scary
- Reality: speed creates stability

Taking pedals off lets kids explore this counterintuitive physics in a simpler, less scary way - **isolating the balance skill** from the pedaling skill.

### The Core Insight

> "Break complex tasks down into simpler ones" wasn't exactly a revelation... But what was a revelation was that **taking the pedals off was even an option.**

The framework question to ask when learning (or teaching) anything:

> **"How do I take the pedals off?"**

### Connection to Isolation Framework

This is the single-loop system in action:

1. Find something **like** the hard thing (bike riding) but **easy** (running while straddling)
2. Modify to be hard in **exactly one way** (balance/coasting, but no pedaling)
3. Practice until that aspect is no longer hard
4. Add the next difficulty (pedaling)

The traditional method fails because it requires mastering **both lessons simultaneously** - balance AND pedaling. Kids can't make progress until they accidentally manage both at once.

### Applications Beyond Bikes

The "take the pedals off" question applies anywhere:

- **Teaching swimming**: Can you isolate floating from kicking from arm strokes?
- **Learning an instrument**: Can you isolate rhythm from melody from reading notation?
- **Public speaking**: Can you isolate structure from delivery from handling nerves?
- **Coding**: Can you isolate logic from syntax from tooling?

Always ask: **What's the pedals here, and can I remove them?**

## Anders Ericsson: Deliberate Practice and Expert Performance

*Source: [Deliberate Practice and Acquisition of Expert Performance - Academic Emergency Medicine, 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00227.x) - Added: 2026-01-18*

The foundational academic paper on deliberate practice from K. Anders Ericsson, whose research underlies much of modern expertise theory.

### The Core Insight: Experience ≠ Expertise

**Traditional view of expertise:**
- Length of experience
- Reputation and credentials
- Perceived mastery of knowledge

**Reality:** Recent research shows only a **weak relationship** between these indicators and actual observed performance. In many professional domains:
- Performance does not correlate with years of experience
- Sometimes performance *decreases* after initial training
- Peer-nominated "experts" often perform no better than average colleagues

### What Actually Predicts Expert Performance

Expert performance can be traced to **deliberate practice (DP)** - training specifically designed to improve particular tasks. DP requires four conditions:

1. **Well-defined goal** - Task has a clear, specific target
2. **Motivation to improve** - Active engagement, not passive participation
3. **Immediate feedback** - Know right away what worked/didn't
4. **Repetition and refinement** - Opportunities to try again with adjustments

DP requires **full concentration** and often involves problem-solving to find better methods.

### The Automaticity Trap

After ~50 hours of practice in most recreational activities (skiing, tennis, driving), performance:
- Adapts to typical situational demands
- Becomes increasingly **automated**
- Loses conscious control
- No longer improves with additional experience

> "When performance has reached this level of automaticity and effortless execution, additional experience will not improve the accuracy of behavior."

**This explains why more experience doesn't equal more expertise** - once automated, you're just repeating the same patterns.

### How Experts Avoid the Automaticity Trap

Aspiring experts **deliberately counteract automaticity** by:
- Actively setting new goals
- Establishing higher performance standards
- Requiring increased speed, accuracy, and control
- Seeking training situations beyond current reliable performance

Over years of daily practice, experts develop the ability to:
- Monitor their own performance
- Identify errors and improvable aspects
- Take over the evaluative role of teachers/coaches

### The 10,000 Hour Finding

To reach international competitive levels requires ~10,000 hours of deliberate practice across domains (sports, sciences, arts). Most elite performers need considerably longer.

**Historical evidence:** Performance levels have risen dramatically over time because training methods improved and practice durations expanded. Today's serious amateurs could beat Olympic gold medalists from a century ago.

### The Tennis Example

A tennis player will **not** improve their backhand volley just by playing more games. Instead, a coach can provide deliberate practice:

1. Place relatively easy volleys
2. Gradually increase unpredictability and difficulty
3. Later integrate backhand volleys into game contexts

### The Chess Study Method

Chess players improve decision-making through deliberate practice by:

1. Studying published games between world-class players
2. Playing through one move at a time
3. Selecting the best move **before** seeing the master's choice
4. If their move matches → nothing to change
5. If different → analyze why they missed what the master saw
6. Reflect on their thought process and how to change it

**This method transfers to other domains:** Medical cases could be recreated with known correct actions, letting learners make decisions and get immediate feedback by comparing to expert choices.

### Expert Intuition vs. Challenging Situations

Common wisdom: "When things proceed normally, experts don't solve problems and don't make decisions, they do what normally works."

**But this misses the point.** Treating a healthy adult for a cold requires no expertise - anyone can do it. Expert performance shows up in **challenging situations**:
- Patients with poor prognosis
- Rare diseases
- Multiple interacting conditions
- Novel situations never experienced firsthand

For these challenging cases, some professionals reliably achieve superior outcomes - and this traces back to special training and deliberate practice.

### Why Real-Time Performance Limits Learning

During professional activities, public performances, and competitions:
- Priority is on consistent high-level performance
- Can't stop to analyze mistakes
- Must proceed and minimize disruption
- Reflection has to wait until after

**Solution:** Simulations and recreated cases allow:
- Practicing when fully rested
- Confronting appropriately challenging situations
- Getting immediate feedback
- Multiple trials with reflection and correction

### Implications for Training Design

Ideal training situations:
- **Short duration activities** with immediate feedback
- **Reflection and correction** opportunities after each trial
- **Progressive difficulty** - cases just above current ability level
- **Known correct actions** - retrospective analysis reveals best approaches
- **Integration** - embed mastered skills into more complex contexts

### Connection to Other Frameworks

**This is the academic foundation for:**
- The single-loop isolation system (modify one difficulty at a time)
- Practice surface area (informal practice supplements structured DP)
- "Take the pedals off" approach (isolate skills for focused improvement)
- Karpathy's "eurekas per second" metric (immediate feedback on understanding)

**Key insight synthesis:** The isolation framework + deliberate practice = avoid automaticity by always working on something slightly beyond current ability, with clear feedback on success/failure.

### Why This Matters for Self-Directed Learning

Most professionals plateau early because:
1. They reach "good enough" performance
2. It becomes automated
3. Additional experience just reinforces existing patterns
4. No feedback loop identifies what could improve

To keep improving:
1. Identify specific weaknesses in challenging (not routine) situations
2. Design practice targeting those weaknesses
3. Get immediate feedback
4. Repeat with refinements
5. Integrate into full performance context

## Orbit: Spaced Repetition Platform Implementation

*Source: https://github.com/andymatuschak/orbit - Added: 2026-01-19*

Andy Matuschak's experimental platform for implementing spaced repetition systems and the "mnemonic medium" concept.

### What It Is

Orbit is an open-source platform for publishing and engaging with small tasks repeatedly over time. Primary focus is supporting the **mnemonic medium** - a way of augmenting texts so readers can easily remember key details.

**Example in the wild:** [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/) - a textbook on quantum computation that embeds spaced repetition prompts directly in the reading experience.

### Core Philosophy

> "Orbit aspires to offer a more general form of spaced repetition systems like Anki, as part of a connected cloud service."

**But also:** Orbit is primarily a **research vehicle**, not a polished product. Goal is understanding the scope of these systems and what they want to become.

### How It Works

**Task Storage & Scheduling:**
- Stores collection of tasks and manages their schedules
- Tasks can be ingested from web (APIs, embedded iframes)
- Can complete tasks in desktop, mobile, web apps
- Backend syncs user data and orchestrates notifications

**Technical Architecture:**
- Mono-repo with modular TypeScript packages
- Components run in Node, web browsers, and React Native
- Mix of backend and frontend operations

### Licensing Strategy

Unusual approach designed to be permissive while discouraging commercial copycats:

- **Libraries:** Apache License 2.0 (permissive)
- **Client apps & cloud service:** Dual-licensed
  - AGPL3+ for open-source use
  - BUSL1.1 for non-production use
- **Official binaries:** Distributed under Apache 2.0 (so AGPL-phobic orgs can install)

### Contributing Philosophy

Orbit doesn't aspire to be a typical open-source project with broad community participation. Direction determined by Andy Matuschak and direct collaborators.

**They will work with serious contributors:**
- Engage with existing GitHub issues (especially "help wanted")
- Start small, build relationship
- Contributor Agreement required (joint copyright assignment)

### The Mnemonic Medium Concept

Collaborative idea with Michael Nielsen: embedding memory prompts directly into reading material so key concepts stick naturally.

**The vision:** Instead of reading → separate flashcard creation → review, the text itself guides you to remember what matters as you read.

### Connection to Learning Frameworks

**Complements isolation practice:**
- Deliberate practice isolates skills
- Spaced repetition ensures isolated skills are retained long-term
- Orbit makes retention effortless by integrating prompts into content consumption

**Connection to practice surface area:**
- Mobile/web apps turn idle moments into review sessions
- Scheduled notifications bring practice to you
- Background processing for long-term memory consolidation

### Funding Model

Free service supported by Patreon community. Notable sponsors include Patrick Collison, Adam Wiggins, Lambda AI Hardware, and others.

### Practical Use Cases

**For authors:**
- Integrate Orbit into educational content
- Help readers retain key concepts automatically
- Preliminary documentation available for implementation

**For learners:**
- Read Orbit-enabled texts (like Quantum Country)
- Review prompts across devices
- Build retention without manual flashcard creation

**For researchers:**
- Study how spaced repetition affects learning at scale
- Experiment with memory augmentation techniques
- Explore programmable attention systems

### Why This Matters

Traditional learning: consume content → hope it sticks → review separately (maybe)

With mnemonic medium: consume content → retention prompts embedded → automatic review schedule → long-term memory

**The leap:** Moving spaced repetition from "study tool" to "reading enhancement" - making memory part of the reading experience itself.
