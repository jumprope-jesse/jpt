## Overview

mymind is a privacy-focused bookmarking and note-taking tool that uses AI to automatically organize saved content. The core philosophy: "Remember everything. Organize nothing."

## Key Features

- **No Manual Organization**: AI automatically categorizes and visualizes saved content - no folders, labels, or tags required
- **Intelligent Content Recognition**: Automatically identifies if a link is an article, product, book, recipe, etc. and displays it appropriately
- **Associative Search**: Search by color, keyword, brand, date, or any detail you remember
- **OCR/Image Search**: Can read text in images (memes, handwritten notes, photos) and make them searchable
- **Distraction-Free Reading**: Strips articles of ads, pop-ups, and clutter
- **Quick Notes**: Capture ideas on the go, expand later in Focus Mode
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Always accessible across devices
- **Privacy First**: Strong emphasis on data privacy and ownership

## Design Philosophy

- Visual-first approach for visual thinkers
- Minimal friction for capturing information
- Works with how your brain naturally recalls (associative, visual cues)
- Focused on spending less time organizing, more time doing

## Use Cases

- Saving inspiration and references
- Bookmarking articles for later reading
- Quick note-taking for fleeting ideas
- Visual mood boards and idea collections
- Marketing research and quote collection

## Comparison Notes

Unlike traditional bookmarking tools (Raindrop.io, Pinboard) or note apps (Notion, Obsidian), mymind:
- Removes organizational burden entirely
- Relies on AI + search rather than hierarchy
- Focuses heavily on visual presentation
- Positions as "extension for your mind" vs productivity tool
