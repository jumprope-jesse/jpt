# Institutional Destruction and Executive Power

Source: NYT Opinion - "The President Will Destroy You Now" (May 2025)

## Core Argument

Scholar consensus that Trump's second term represents unprecedented intentional destruction of American institutions, including:
- Medical research (NIH, CDC, NSF cuts of 40%+)
- Higher education and academic research
- Foreign alliances and trust
- Civil service expertise
- Rule of law and ethical standards

## Expert Assessments

**J. Michael Luttig** (former Bush-appointed federal judge):
> "There had never been a U.S. president who I consider even to have been destructive, let alone a president who has intentionally and deliberately set out to destroy literally every institution in America."

**Sean Wilentz** (Princeton historian):
> "The gutting of expertise and experience going on right now under the blatantly false pretext of eliminating fraud and waste is catastrophic and may never be completely repaired."

When asked for precedent: "There is no precedent, not even close, unless you consider Jefferson Davis an American president."

## Historical Comparisons

Scholars compared to other "destructive" presidents:
- **Andrew Johnson** - Actively prevented Reconstruction and racial reconciliation
- **James Buchanan** - Presided over events leading to Civil War
- Key difference: Those presidencies were shaped by Civil War context; Trump operates without analogous external crisis

## The Manufactured Crisis Problem

Andrew Rudalevige (Bowdoin):
> "In the past, when presidential power has expanded, it has been in response to crisis: the Civil War, World War I, the Depression and World War II, 9/11. But no similar objective crisis faced us. So one had to be declared — via proclamations of 'invasion' and the like — or even created."

Analogy: "An arsonist who rushes to put out the fire he started."

## Elite vs. Populist Agenda

Multiple scholars argue Trump's agenda is elite-driven, not populist:
- Project 2025 adopted despite campaign disavowal
- Russell Riley: "Any president seeking fundamental changes needs to be empowered by the American people... Trump barely won the popular vote, with just under 50 percent — hardly an electoral mandate."
- New Trump voters did not vote for "demolition of the basic structures of governance"

## Long-Term Damage Assessment

**What may be permanent:**
1. Trust in US as safe harbor for rule of law (Rosenzweig)
2. Foreign students' confidence in US universities
3. Allies' confidence in US commitment to secrets and alliances
4. Canada relations as "poster child of ruined trust"
5. Academic/scientific talent leaving for other countries

**What may recover (with effort):**
- Government staffing (though fresh talent has been purged and soured)
- Some foreign relations
- Research programs

## The Congressional Abdication

Key enabler: Republican Congress has allowed executive overreach without pushback, allowing Trump to "create a mandate out of whole cloth."

## Relevance

### For Understanding Institutional Resilience
- Institutions depend on norms as much as laws
- Probationary worker purges remove both fresh perspectives and institutional memory
- "Norms of nonpoliticization in government service have taken a huge hit"

### For Business Environment
- Scientific research disruption affects tech innovation pipeline
- Trade uncertainty and alliance damage affect global business
- Government expertise loss affects regulatory competence

### Connection to Mimetic Theory
Relates to Girard/Thiel analysis in `girard-mimetic-theory-politics.md`:
- Scapegoating of immigrants, academics, "deep state"
- Friend/enemy political framework in action
- Elite actors using populist rhetoric for different agenda
