## Critique of Sam Harris's Argument for Objective Morality

*Source: http://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2024/07/sam-harriss-argument-for-objective.html - Added: 2026-01-18*

A detailed breakdown of why Sam Harris's attempt to ground objective morality in the subjective experience of suffering fails philosophically.

### Harris's Argument (Reconstructed)

1. There are no objective oughts/shoulds (initial premise to negate)
2. Conscious minds exist
3. Some experiences "suck" (pain is objectively bad)
4. We can learn about conscious minds scientifically
5. Therefore, we should avoid what "sucks"
6. We can be wrong about what truly sucks
7. Better solutions are not zero-sum
8. Science can help us avoid what sucks

### The Fundamental Errors

**Question-begging**: The argument presupposes what it attempts to prove.

- "Some experiences suck" uses evaluative language (good/bad) while claiming to derive objective value
- The argument tacitly assumes hedonism (pain = bad, pleasure = good) and altruism (we should care about others' pain)
- Then pretends to derive these assumptions from "pure reason plus experience"

**Conflation of subjective and objective value**:

> "I don't want to put my hand on a hot stove, because I judge that to be bad for me. But I don't care if Sam puts his hand on a hot stove."

- Pain is a subjective experience with inherent personal bias
- My judgment that pain is bad *for me* is not a claim about cosmic normativity
- Whether I care about another's pain depends on my relationship to them

**Conflation of pain and value**:

The author's counterexample: deliberately burning a plantar wart off his thumb with a hot stove. The pain was real; the judgment was that the outcome was good.

> "Value is a judgment. Pain and pleasure are feelings. Sam conflates the two, because of his implicit hedonism."

### The Central Flaw

The claim that pain's existence proves objective badness is "idiotic":

> "The subjective experience of pain does not imply the existence of objective value."

Knowledge about what causes pain is:
- Knowledge about causal relationships
- Not knowledge about cosmic normativity

We can use knowledge of reality to make value judgments, but values are not knowledge of reality. We *project* value onto reality through our ideas of what is good or bad for us.

### Personal Value vs. Moral Value

Critical distinctions Harris ignores:

1. **Personal subjective value**: I don't want to burn myself
2. **Moral value**: I ought to prevent others from being burned

You can avoid what "sucks" (to you) without believing in morality:

> "Amorality is perfectly consistent with having personal, selfish values."

The author doesn't believe:
- That others have a cosmic obligation not to harm him
- That he has a cosmic obligation not to harm others
- He simply doesn't want to harm himself

### The Cosmic Perspective Problem

Harris assumes a "cosmic value standard" without justifying it:

> "There is no one for whom 'better' is defined by the sum of individual utilities. There are just individuals, judging outcomes from their own perspectives."

A group might agree to work toward positive-sum outcomes—this would be a collective value existing from the group's perspective. It would not be a cosmic value.

### What Morality Actually Is

The author's view:

> "Morality is a complex delusion. It involves the delusion of a cosmic perspective, from which some things are good or bad, right or wrong. It involves the delusion that our social values and rules of behavior (such as 'Don't commit murder') are cosmic."

The truth:
- We are selfish animals with social behaviors
- We can form societies and agree on collective values
- We then impose these values on ourselves
- There is no cosmic value standard or cosmic imperatives

### Key Insight

> "There is no cosmic perspective. There is no God, Sam."

The argument's fundamental flaw is treating subjective experience as evidence for objective normativity—a category error.

- **Hedonism**: The implicit assumption that pain is bad and pleasure is good
- **Moral realism**: The view that objective moral truths exist
- **Moral anti-realism**: The rejection of objective moral facts
- **Is-ought problem** (Hume): The impossibility of deriving normative claims from descriptive facts
- **Naturalistic fallacy** (Moore): Attempting to define "good" in natural terms

## Connection to Other Ideas

- **Contrasts with altruism-virtue-philosophy**: That file explores whether we *should* be altruistic from a virtue ethics perspective; this piece argues the question itself is malformed because there's no cosmic "should"
- **Relates to self-help philosophy critique**: Both challenge the hidden assumptions in seemingly obvious claims about what's good or bad
- **Echoes LessWrong evolutionary psychology**: The evolutionary view (in self-help critique file) suggests our values are misaligned with fitness; this piece goes further—there's no cosmic value they could be aligned *with*
