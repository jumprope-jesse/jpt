# Day Plan System for Executive Function

A TODO list optimized for managing anxiety and executive dysfunction, at the cost of not being as good a traditional TODO list. The key insight: TODO lists create guilt; this system is designed so that using it should always be better than not.

## Core Rules

1. **Disposable** - Throw away at end of day, never to be looked at again
2. **No rollover** - Never refer to yesterday's plan. If you need persistence, use a separate system
3. **Could do, not should do** - A list of options, not commitments

## The Ritual

**Starting (do this early):**
1. Take a sheet of paper
2. Write today's date at top
3. Write "Start day plan" below it
4. Immediately cross through "Start day plan"

Don't skip the ritual - it removes decision points and anxiety about starting.

## How to Use

1. Every time you think of something that might be good to do today → write it down
2. Every time you do something useful that you didn't plan → write it down and immediately cross it off
3. When unsure what to do next → look at the Day Plan
4. When doing something you shouldn't be → engage with the Day Plan

## Why It Works

Traditional TODO lists create "ugh fields" - guilt-inducing backlogs that become things you avoid. The Day Plan eliminates anxiety sources:

- **Disposal** - Can't hang around as guilt
- **Ritualized start** - No decision points, no hard questions
- **"Could do" framing** - Externalizes state rather than creates commitment

## As a Reflective Tool

The Day Plan reveals when you're having a bad day:

**"14-step coffee day"** concept: How many steps does making coffee take today?
- Good day: "make coffee" isn't even on the list
- Okay day: "make coffee" is one item
- Bad day: "Put water in coffee maker..." becomes its own item

**"How long is a Pomodoro right now?"**
- Normal: 25-45 minutes
- Bad day: Even 5 minutes is too much
- Solution: Do 5-minute Pomodoros until you can face longer ones

**Key insight:** The more trivial the tasks you need to write down, the worse your day is, and the more gently you need to treat yourself.

## Why This Complements Other Systems

- Works alongside persistent task management (separate from Day Plan)
- Pairs with "poisoning the day" philosophy - both acknowledge daily fluctuation
- Provides the "What can I face right now?" question that adapts to your current capacity
- End of day with items still incomplete is expected and healthy
