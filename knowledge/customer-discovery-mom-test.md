# The Mom Test - Customer Discovery Framework

Summary of Rob Fitzpatrick's book on conducting useful customer conversations during product discovery.

## Core Principle

Don't ask people if your idea is good. Ask questions about their life and problems that even your mom can't lie about.

- **You own the solution**, they own the problem
- It's YOUR responsibility to find the truth by asking good questions
- Bad customer conversations are worse than useless - they mislead you

## The Mom Test Rules

1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**

## Avoiding Bad Data

Three types of bad data to watch for:

| Type | Example | How to Handle |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Compliments | "That sounds great!" | Deflect, pivot to specifics about their past |
| Fluff | "I would definitely use that" | Ask about past behavior instead of hypotheticals |
| Ideas | "You should add feature X" | Dig into the underlying problem |

### Key Deflection Techniques

- "When was the last time you had that problem? Talk me through how it went down."
- "Why do you recommend that? What problem would it solve?"
- "Tell me about a time when you had that problem."

### Pathos Problem
Exposing your ego ("I quit my job for this") makes people too uncomfortable to be critical.

## Asking Important Questions

- Seek world-rocking questions that could indicate failure
- **Learn to love bad news** - failing fast beats failing slow
- Decide on the 3 most important things to learn before each meeting

## Finding Conversations

### Goal: Warm Intros
Cold outreach is a means to an end. Work toward warm introductions.

**The snowball effect:**
1. Hustle for initial meetings via cold outreach
2. At each meeting, ask: "Is there anyone else you think I should talk to?"
3. Get introduced, repeat - leads to exponential growth in contacts

### Going to Them
- Industry events, meetups, conferences
- Find people where they already are

### Bringing Them to You
- Organize events/meetups in the industry you're targeting
- This positions you as important enough to meet with

### Meeting Setup
- Frame meetings beforehand - address concerns about time/sales-y vibes
- Keep it casual - "chat" not "meeting"
- In person > calls (nonverbal cues matter)
- One or two people max (more feels intimidating)

## Commitment and Advancement

Ask for commitments to avoid "zombie customers" who string you along:

| Commitment Type | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| Time | Multi-hour wireframe review, weeks of prototype testing |
| Money | Pre-orders, deposits |
| Reputation | Intros to peers/decision-makers, public testimonials |

## Choosing Customers

- **Problem**: Target audience not narrow enough
- **Rule of thumb**: If you're not finding consistent problems/goals, segment isn't specific enough
- **Customer segments** = who-where pair (if you can't find them, slice narrower)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Talk is cheap** - check if they've actually tried to solve the problem
2. **Warm intros >> cold outreach**
3. **Don't expose your ego** - makes honest feedback impossible
4. **Ask about past actions** - hard to lie about
5. **Biggest mistake**: being too formal
6. **Seek evangelists/early adopters** - they're gold

## Red Flag: The "Fake Problem"

People claim something is a big problem, get emotional, say they'd pay... but haven't taken steps to solve it. This indicates the problem isn't big enough (usually).

However: humans aren't automatically strategic. Someone might have a real problem and still never Google for solutions. Use as an indicator, not absolute proof.
