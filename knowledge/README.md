# Knowledge

Reference material processed from the inbox. General knowledge outside of direct work and personal life.

## What Goes Here

- Tech industry trends, tools, techniques
- Leadership and management insights
- Parenting approaches and resources
- Economics, finance, policy
- Books and ideas that shape thinking
- Anything worth remembering that isn't a task, person, or active project

## Structure

Files are organized organically. As patterns emerge, subfolders may be created:

```
knowledge/
├── tech/           → Industry trends, tools
├── leadership/     → Management, strategy
├── parenting/      → Child development
├── economics/      → Finance, markets, policy
└── (more as needed)
```

## File Naming

Use descriptive kebab-case names:
- `react-server-components.md`
- `engineering-leadership-principles.md`
- `toddler-sleep-training.md`

## Archive

Old or outdated knowledge moves to `.archive/` rather than being deleted.
