## The Core Problem

**Tension between two failures:**
1. **Atomic individualism** ("do as you will, harm none") - Doesn't account for culture, community effects, and indirect harms (tobacco ads, sugary drinks, objectifying media)
2. **Enforced virtue** - Letting communities police values leads to oppression of minorities and endless culture wars

Current society is precariously balanced between these - generally liberal, but with lots of Enforced Virtue (porn restrictions, social pressure against atheism in some communities, etc.). Works okay for most but leaves many unfree.

## The Archipelago Thought Experiment

Imagine a new frontier opens. Anyone can gather like-minded friends and found a voluntary community:

- **Paleoconservatives**: Communities based on virtue, banning sexual deviancy, wholesome media only
- **Social justice advocates**: Strong minority representation, strict anti-slur norms
- **Objectivists**: Strict Principle of Harm, no business regulations, super-capitalist
- **Weight-loss focused**: No open donut boxes in break rooms

### UniGov's Role (Minimal Central Government)

1. **Ban inter-community war** - Military exists only to stop invasions
2. **Handle externalities** - Carbon emissions, cross-community pollution
3. **Prevent memetic contamination** - Communities can control what media reaches them
4. **Protect children** - The hard problem

### The Child Problem

If conservative Christians have an atheist lesbian daughter:
- **Minimum**: Absolute freedom of movement. Daughter can request exit at UniGov embassy anytime, gets free transport to compatible community (Lesbiantopia). Any coercion to prevent exit = UniGov "burns their city and salts their field"
- **More robust**: UniGov mandates basic education for all children about other communities, provides non-brainwashed worldview, makes exit rights known

### Other UniGov Functions

- **Prevent malicious transfers**: People who benefit from high-tax community's education can't just leave to avoid taxes. They pay excess taxes to UniGov as disincentive.
- **Redistributive taxation**: From wealthier communities to less wealthy ones
- **Strong patriotism**: Everyone proud of being part of "Archipelago of Civilized Communities" - the system that allows distinctiveness

## Why This Appeals to Multiple Ideologies

**Libertarian utopia** (Nozick connection):
- UniGov is a perfect minarchist night watchman state
- Any additions chosen by free will

**Conservative utopia**:
- Strong cohesive communities of similar people around common values
- Build your white-picket-fence God-fearing community (basically Utah)
- No bureaucrats telling you what to do

**Liberal/leftist utopia** (Alexander's personal take):
1. **Extends liberalism**: Solve disagreements by letting everyone do their own thing, one meta-level up. Both sexually-liberated and sexually-pure communities enrich society.
2. **Enables demanding subcultures**: Fat-positive community can ban diet talk; trans community can enforce pronoun norms - but only for willing members
3. **Addresses oppression**: Exit rights disrupt oppressive relationships. If anyone can leave, how long before oppressors say "guess we need to treat people better"?

### The Frederick Douglass Point

> "Do nothing with us! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us."

If black people during slavery could have exited to a black ex-slave community, they would have. True voluntary separation, with equal resources and no white government control, would have been vastly better than historical segregation.

Key distinction: Historical segregation was "separate until white people wanted something from black people." True Archipelago separation means actually separate, including government, with reparations for wealth gaps.

## Practical Applications Today

**We lack**: Vast frontier of unsettled land (though seasteaders try)

**What we can do**: Become more Archipelagian on the margin

### Example: Conservative Christian Law School in Canada

Province tried to deny accreditation because "conservative Christians are icky" (homophobia concerns). Alexander's view: Let icky people form voluntary communities enforcing icky norms. Don't like it? Go to other law schools. Gays can found gay-friendly law schools too.

### White Separatists

> "I think white separatists have exactly the right position about where the sort of white people who want to be white separatists should be relative to everyone else - separate."

Why would black people want white separatist neighbors? Let them self-segregate.

### Fracture of Society into Subcultures (The Real Path)

**Trans communities**: Build networks of trans friends, cis allies educated on trans issues, databases of trans-friendly businesses/doctors. Use trigger warnings to curate information. Majority of social life online = easy to limit to trans-friendly spaces.

**Rationalist community**: Could move to Bay Area, have rationalist roommates, live in rationalist group house, date rationalists, work at CFAR/Quixey, never interact with non-rationalists again.

**The internet enables Archipelago**: Already hanging out more with Finns/Brits/Aussies than next-door neighbors. Social networks, bitcoin, Mechanical Turk make most interaction digital. Community norms matter more than national laws.

## Key Philosophical Points

**On the Principle of Harm:**
- **Strict**: Only violence and theft count as harm
- **Loose**: Indirect harms count (eroding trust, objectifying media, etc.)

Nobody wants pure Strict principle. But Loose principle restores all the old wars: "Gay marriage increases STDs! Harm! Ban it!" vs "Religious schools cause hate crimes! Harm! Ban them!"

**On exit rights:**

> "If people want to go do their own thing in a way that harms no one else, you let them. That's the Archipelagian way."

**On seasteaders**: People trying to go do their own thing in the ocean "without bothering anyone" get compared to racists and called "un-American, sinister." Alexander finds this distasteful.

**On finding utopia:**

> "The closer you come to true freedom of association, the closer you get to a world where everyone is a member of more or less the community they deserve."
