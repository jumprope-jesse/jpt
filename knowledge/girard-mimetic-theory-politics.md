## Core Concepts

### Mimetic Desire (Triangular Desire)

The foundation of Girard's thought: human desire is not autonomous but imitative.

**The Triangle**: Subject → Model → Object
- We don't desire objects directly; we desire what others (models/mediators) desire
- The model indicates the object as desirable by desiring it themselves
- We copy this desire and appropriate it as our own, often unconsciously
- This includes identity formation, transmission of norms, and material aspirations

**External vs. Internal Mediation**:
- *External*: Model is socially beyond reach (fictional characters, celebrities) → optimistic folly (Don Quixote imitating Amadis de Gaula)
- *Internal*: Model is at same social level → model becomes rival and obstacle → rivalry intensifies as object's value increases

**Key insight**: "It is not difference that dominates the world, but the obliteration of difference by mimetic reciprocity." The erasure of differences through mimicry creates conflict, not differentiation itself.

### The Scapegoat Mechanism

Girard's second major hypothesis, developed in *Violence and the Sacred* (1972):

1. **Mimetic contagion**: If two people desire the same thing, a third joins, then a fourth... rivalry snowballs
2. **Shift from object to antagonism**: Eventually the object is forgotten; people imitate each other's hostility rather than desires for objects
3. **Convergence on a victim**: Violence focuses on an arbitrary victim; unanimous antipathy grows mimetically
4. **Catharsis through murder**: The victim's elimination releases the violence that possessed the group
5. **Sacralization**: The victim appears simultaneously as cause of the crisis AND source of miraculous peace → becomes sacred

This is the genesis of archaic religion:
- **Ritual sacrifice** = repetition of the original event
- **Myth** = account of the event (told from the persecutors' perspective, claiming victim's guilt)
- **Taboos** = forbid access to objects that triggered the rivalries

### The Biblical Revelation

What makes Judeo-Christian texts unique according to Girard:

- Myths are told from the *persecutors'* perspective, requiring the victim's guilt for legitimacy
- The Gospels proclaim the *innocence* of the victim
- This attacks the ignorance that makes sacrificial violence effective
- Old Testament already shows this reversal: Abel, Joseph, Job, the Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53)
- The Passion reveals "things hidden since the foundation of the world" (Matthew 13:35) - the foundation of social order on murder

Christianity hasn't ended violence but acts as a "ferment" decomposing the sacrificial order. As ignorance recedes, sacrificial violence loses efficacy, but this also deprives societies of their capacity for violence-based peace.

## Girard's Core Ideas (Summary)

### Mimetic Theory
- Human desires are not innate but shaped by imitating others
- This imitation leads to rivalry as individuals compete for the same objects or status
- Rivalry escalates into conflict, and societies historically restored order through scapegoating
- Scapegoating transfers collective aggression onto an innocent victim, temporarily uniting the community but perpetuating cycles of violence concealed by myths

### The Modern Concern for Victims
- The Judeo-Christian tradition unmasks the scapegoating mechanism by giving voice to victims
- This "modern concern for victims" is what Girard called the Absolute of our contemporary world
- It emerged as societies recognized and rejected the injustice of scapegoating
- Has a shadow side: the manipulation of victimhood to justify aggression against others

### Human Nature and Violence
- Girard sees mimetic capacity as "intrinsically good" because it represents an "extreme openness" to others
- This openness enables humans to progress away from evil and follow good role models
- Violence is not hardwired but a "tragically necessary" outcome once violence enters human arrangements
- "If violence and war were triggered by our biological makeup, individual human beings would be unable to repress their aggressive impulses"

### Two Totalitarianisms
1. **First Totalitarianism**: Cynical dismissal of concern for victims altogether (Nietzsche, Nazis)
2. **Second Totalitarianism**: Distorted appropriation of concern for victims that seeks to outflank Judeo-Christian ethics on its own left (political correctness as manipulation)

Girard critiqued both left and right for misusing the concern for victims.

## Peter Thiel's Misappropriation

### Background
- Thiel studied with Girard at Stanford in a reading group during the 1990s
- Also influenced by Robert Hamerton-Kelly, who pushed a more deterministic, Calvinist interpretation of mimetic theory
- Hamerton-Kelly treated mimetic violence as an "automatic mechanism hardwired into our species" - diverging from Girard's nuanced view

### "The Straussian Moment" (2004)
Thiel's essay argues:
- Enlightenment liberalism is insufficient against ideologically driven adversaries
- The West must adopt Carl Schmitt's friend/enemy distinction
- Survival requires dismantling traditional democratic safeguards
- Hidden within the essay (in untranslated German/Latin): endorsement of Spengler's "Caesarism"

### Key Divergences from Girard

**On Human Nature:**
- Thiel adopts Schmitt's view that humans are fundamentally evil/violent
- Girard sees mimetic capacity as fundamentally good, with violence as a contingent but self-perpetuating outcome

**On the Friend/Enemy Distinction:**
- Thiel embraces Schmitt's binary framework
- Girard in "Battling to the End" critiques this as obsolete and perilous: "Carl Schmitt's legal voluntarism has proven vain"

**On Political Action:**
- Thiel advocates for elite action outside democratic norms
- Girard cautioned: "We are caught in a whirlwind of transformations over which we have little control, and which we must try to manage as best we can"
- Girard recommended "a more reasonable, renewed ideology of liberalism and progress"

### J.D. Vance's Application
- Claims Girard taught him to recognize his own tendency to scapegoat
- Yet engaged in classic scapegoating with false claims about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio
- Admitted willingness to "create stories" for political gain
- Demonstrates how the concern for victims can be inverted to justify one's own scapegoating

## Key Girard Quotes

On political action:
> "Those who want to accelerate [political] movement too much have motivations that are not far from resentment."

> "There are many people who give themselves a good conscience in political action when they are simply motivated by ambition."

On avoiding weakening differences:
> "Above all, what must not be done is weaken the differences that still exist."

On mimetic desire:
> "Mimetic desire is everything. It can be murderous, it is rivalrous. But it is also the basis of heroism, and devotion to others, and everything."

On self-awareness:
> "Almost no one is aware of his own shortcoming."

## Relevance

### For Understanding Tech/Power Dynamics
- Thiel's influence on Silicon Valley and venture capital operates through mimetic principles
- Facebook began as a platform rooted in competition and social validation
- Tech platforms leverage mimetic desire for engagement

### For Leadership and Ethics
- Recognizing scapegoating patterns in organizational dynamics
- The difference between genuine concern for victims and performative victimhood claims
- Managing rivalry and competition constructively

### For Political Discourse
- Both left and right can manipulate victimhood narratives
- The collapse of clear friend/enemy distinctions increases mimetic conflict
- Beware those who advocate dismantling institutions without understanding what violence they contain

## The Author's Argument

The essay contends that Thiel's real political vision, hidden within "The Straussian Moment," is an endorsement of post-democratic Caesarism - not the measured conclusion about balancing peace and violence. Thiel uses Strauss's concept of esoteric writing to embed his true message for "trustworthy and intelligent readers only."

The author, a fellow member of Girard's reading group, argues Thiel has been "betrayed" by his chosen texts (Schmitt, Strauss, Spengler) much like Paolo and Francesca in Dante - captivated by models that blind him to their consequences.

## Criticisms of Girard

### Originality
- Gabriel Tarde's *The Laws of Imitation* (1890) preceded Girard
- La Rochefoucauld in the 17th century: "Nothing is so infectious as example"
- Hobbes: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies"
- Spinoza on emotional contagion
- Tocqueville on how equality increases mimetic desire

### Non-Mimetic Desires
- How to explain taboo desires (homosexuality in repressive societies)?
- Every situation has multiple potential mediators - doesn't this require authentic choice?
- Where does innovation come from? Someone must be first to desire a new object

### Evidentiary Issues
- Critics argue Girard's readings of myths and biblical texts are tendentious
- Hayden White called his work "metaphysics rather than science"
- Luc de Heusch: "The Gospel according to Saint Girard"
- Anthropologists critique his one-size-fits-all approach that "annihilates the cultures which produced" the data

### Beneficial Imitation
- Early Girard left no room for positive imitation
- Rebecca Adams proposed "creative mimesis" - healthy emulation
- If beneficial imitation is possible, cultures needn't be born through scapegoating
