# Inchtuthil Roman Nail Hoard

Archaeological discovery from 1959 at the Roman legionary fortress near Dunkeld, Scotland.

## The Discovery

- Over 800,000 nails found in a 12-foot deep pit beneath the workshop (Fabrica)
- Largest single deposit of Roman nails ever found
- Many in remarkable preservation due to a "sacrificial" rust crust on top absorbing moisture

## The Nails

- Sizes range from 38mm to 372mm (small joinery to massive timber spikes)
- All handmade at forge, square in section, tapering from head to tip
- Largest nails spiked together primary timbers of defensive towers
- Required pilot holes drilled with auger bits before final hammering

## Historical Context

- Fortress built ~84 AD after Agricola's victory at Mons Graupius (83 AD)
- Abandoned 87-90 AD due to legion withdrawals for crises elsewhere in empire
- Part of Rome's second Scottish frontier (Doune to Stracathro)
- Nails were likely stockpiled for planned expansion northward

## Why Buried

The stockpile weighed ~10 tons - too heavy to transport south during hurried evacuation. A centurion ordered soldiers to dig a pit, dump the nails, pack it flat, and burn the workshop over it. The concealment worked - natives never found it.

Iron was more valuable than gold to Scottish tribes because weapons. Leaving it behind would have armed Rome's enemies.

## Aftermath

- Sir Ian Richmond gifted nails to museums worldwide
- Bulk of hoard was recycled at Dalzell steelworks in Motherwell
- The iron may have originally come from melted-down Caledonian weapons captured at Mons Graupius - reforged into nails for Roman occupation infrastructure

## Key Insight

The find provides a "snapshot in time" of the chaos of Roman withdrawal from Scotland. Counters the myth of orderly, forensic Roman demolition practices - this was a hard-pressed retreat.
