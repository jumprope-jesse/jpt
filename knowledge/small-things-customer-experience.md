## Core Thesis

Small gestures and details create lasting impressions. In a world of abundance and noise, scarcity and genuine care stand out. The rare is meaningful; the special resonates.

## Key Examples

### Brand Touchpoints (State Farm)
- Insurance card quality has deteriorated over decades while premiums increase
- This is the only brand interaction most customers have (absent claims)
- Cost optimization destroyed the twice-annual customer touchpoint
- Consider reallocating media spend to enhance actual customer interactions

### Service Differentiation (Airlines)
Same aircraft, same catering, dramatically different experiences between United and Singapore Airlines:
- Staff knowing your name and making eye contact
- Hot towels that are actually hot
- Quality of small items (eye masks, utensils, napkins)
- Smiles are free

One airline asks "how much cost can we remove" - the other asks "how can a few extra dollars on a multi-thousand dollar ticket make a difference."

### Human Relationships
When someone is in career transition - laid off, company tanked, lost their big title - that's exactly when to respond to them:
- Most people only call back when someone has power/status
- Those who help during hard times create lasting relationships
- People remember forever who was there when few others were

## Marketing Implications

### Traditional Approach
Marketers focus on high-susceptibility moments: life changes, account openings, checkout flows. Problem: everyone knows these moments, costs are high, customers are weary.

### Alternative Approach
Surprise people positively when they least expect it:
- Give free samples instead of advertising
- Reallocate "stop them from unsubscribing" budget to reward loyal customers
- Proactively cut fees or upgrade services for loyal customers to say thank you

"When someone least expects an act of generosity it has a tattoo-like impact."

## Actionable Principles

1. **Identify your touchpoints** - Where does your brand actually interact with customers? Optimize those, not just media spend.

2. **Traffic in scarcity** - One or two genuine "surprise and delights" worth more than a year of messaging.

3. **Help people when they can't help you** - The relationship compounds when they recover.

4. **Small upgrades on expensive purchases** - Don't be penny wise, pound foolish.

5. **Ask the right question** - Not "what can we cut?" but "what small thing will make someone come away different?"
