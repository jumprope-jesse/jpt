# LLM Intelligence: Clever Hans, Plato, and Emergent Behavior

A philosophical analysis of LLM "intelligence" through historical parallels, arguing that apparent intelligence emerges from interaction rather than intrinsic reasoning.

## Core Thesis

The apparent intelligence of LLMs, like the slave boy in Plato's Meno and Clever Hans the horse, emerges not from intrinsic reasoning but from responsive guidance. Intelligence is relational—shaped by context, collaboration, and the interplay between system and environment.

## The Clever Hans Effect

Clever Hans (early 20th century) appeared to solve arithmetic by tapping his hoof, but was actually responding to subtle cues from his handler:
- Handler unconsciously signaled correct answers through posture/facial changes
- The horse's "intelligence" was sensitivity to external stimuli, not calculation
- Perceived intelligence emerged from attunement to environmental signals

## Socratic Method as Iterative Prompting

Socrates' questioning of the slave boy in Meno mirrors LLM prompting:
- Socrates guides with targeted questions that converge on correct answers
- Creates illusion the boy arrived at conclusions independently
- "I shall only ask him, and not teach him"
- The reasoning is Socrates'—the boy provides arithmetic responses following implicit direction

**Key insight**: Without Socrates' guidance, the process fails to produce meaningful conclusions—same with uninformed LLM prompting.

## LLM Mechanics

LLMs generate responses by:
1. Outputting probability distribution across vocabulary tokens
2. Selecting likely words to continue input text
3. Mirroring patterns from training data

**The hallucination framing is misleading**:
- Suggests LLMs have a baseline for correctness
- In reality, *every* response is a form of hallucination
- Some align with factual reality, others don't
- LLMs cannot independently validate responses or distinguish correct from plausible-but-wrong

## Why Prompting "Works"

When iterative prompting appears to improve results:
- User's guidance steers the model, not the model's reasoning
- Each refinement acts as a corrective signal
- Skilled prompters (consciously or not) convey contextual cues
- Like Hans's handler, the prompter enables the illusion of independent intelligence

**Critical limitation**: When the user lacks knowledge of the correct answer, the LLM easily veers off track, reinforcing inaccuracies.

## Implications for Intelligence

### Traditional View (Challenged)
- Intelligence as intrinsic property of agents
- Located in reason, understanding, or cognitive capacity
- Modern AI research privileges this view

### Relational View (Proposed)
- Intelligence as emergent from interaction
- Not static attribute but dynamic process
- Socrates' method, Clever Hans, and LLM prompting all depend on interplay between system and environment
- "Responding adaptively to external input" rather than "reasoning in isolation"

## Reframing Anamnesis (Recollection)

Plato's concept that the slave boy "recollected" innate knowledge can be reinterpreted:
- Not retrieval from inherent knowledge store
- Rather: iterative alignment of external cues with preexisting cognitive structures
- Responses emerge from guided interaction, not intrinsic wellspring

LLMs similarly don't "recall" knowledge—they generate responses that statistically approximate training data patterns, nudged by user refinements.

## Practical Implications

### For AI Development
- AGI pursuit assumes human cognition can be algorithmically reproduced
- Dreyfus (What Computers Can't Do) challenged this: human intelligence operates through lived experience, intuitive understanding, contextual awareness
- These resist reduction to computation

### For AI Use
The value of AI may lie not in what it "knows" but in:
- How it prompts better questions
- Fostering collaborative exploration
- Augmenting human inquiry rather than replacing it

### The Shift in Promise
From: Creating autonomous intelligences
To: Amplifying human creativity and problem-solving through interaction

## Connection to Other Concepts

**Expert-Observer Paradox** (Bainbridge): The more advanced the system, the more crucial the human operator—but operators can only properly monitor by doing the work the AI does.

**Feedback Loop Pattern** (Anthropic Economic Index): 35% of Claude Code interactions involve autonomous completion with human validation—intelligence emerging through collaborative iteration.

**The Leadership Dilemma**: Directing AI agents requires fundamentally different skills than doing work directly—a leadership role most people haven't been trained for.

## Key Quote

> "Iterative prompting, like Socratic questioning, may never produce true intelligence in the systems it engages with, but it reveals the collaborative nature of intelligence itself—an emergent property shaped by context, guidance, and the interplay of minds, human or otherwise."
