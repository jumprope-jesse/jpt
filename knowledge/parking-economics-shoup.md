# Parking Economics and the Shoup Movement

Donald Shoup (d. February 2025) - UCLA professor who revolutionized parking policy. His 2005 book "The High Cost of Free Parking" launched an international reform movement.

## Core Economic Arguments

**The Problem with "Free" Parking**
- Unpriced curb parking creates tragedy of the commons
- At price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing scarcity
- Drivers spend ~8 min/trip cruising for parking (~49 hrs/year wasted)
- ~30% of city traffic is just cruising for parking
- "Free" parking isn't free - hidden costs passed to consumers, housing prices, etc.

**Minimum Parking Requirements**
- Columbus, OH first required off-street parking in 1923
- Based on pseudoscientific "Parking Generation Manual" (often <10 observations per estimate)
- Results: 38% of typical downtown is surface parking lots
- Each parking space adds $20K-$80K to development costs
- Makes housing more expensive, forces car dependency into law

## The Solution: Parking Benefits Districts

Political problem: Removing parking minimums requires pricing curb parking, which voters hate.

Shoup's insight: **Return revenue to the neighborhood visibly**
- Street trees, repaved sidewalks, street sweeping
- Once locals see benefits, they demand priced parking
- Example: Old Pasadena transformed from rundown to posh shopping district

**SFPark** (San Francisco) - most complete implementation
- Citywide demand-based pricing with sensors
- Prices fluctuate based on demand, communicated via app
- Reduced congestion, citations; sped up transit; increased sales tax revenue

## Movement Building Lessons

Why Shoup succeeded where other academics fail:

1. **Topic selection**: Important, tractable, neglected
   - "I'm a bottom feeder. But there's a lot of food down here."

2. **Message discipline**: 50 years on one topic
   - Avoided all other political positions
   - When asked about campus protests: "I'm just wondering where they all parked."

3. **Cross-partisan appeal**:
   - Conservative: People should pay for services they consume
   - Progressive: Unnecessary driving harms environment
   - Libertarian: Prices and markets solve scarcity
   - Socialist: Stop privatizing public realm as free parking

4. **Building next generation**:
   - Trained practitioners and scholars
   - Responded to emails from small-town planners
   - Helped students publish and launch careers
   - Engaged in direct activism when bills needed support

5. **Made it funny**: "When you work on a superficially boring topic, you have to start by making it funny."

## Policy Progress

- 2005: Book published
- 2017: Buffalo, NY and Hartford, CT first to abolish parking minimums citywide
- 2020: New Zealand abolished nationwide
- 2022: California abolished within half-mile of transit statewide
- 99 cities in 8 countries have now abolished minimum parking requirements

## Key Concepts

- **Parking benefits districts**: Price curbs, invest revenue locally
- **Demand-based pricing**: Set price so 1-2 spots always available per block
- **Shoupista**: Self-identified parking reform advocate (term coined 2008)
