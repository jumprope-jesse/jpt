## Executive Summary

This was a heavy reading period with no meetings—50 inbox items processed and 30 knowledge base updates. The intellectual throughput centered on three clusters: (1) philosophy of AI and intelligence, (2) political analysis of the Trump transition and authoritarianism, and (3) practical software engineering philosophy. Your knowledge base now has substantial new material on mimetic theory, moral realism critiques, and type-driven development.

On the task front, AI-delegated tasks continue to churn—you completed the Tailscale audit, feedback email to stakeholders, and Notion agent updates. The JumpRope/Aeries integration remains your biggest pending work item, with multiple subtasks queued. You have an Anthropic/Blackstone webinar on January 23rd to evaluate, and a standing desk purchase decision before February 3rd.

## Key Themes

**Philosophy of Mind & AI**: Multiple articles explored whether LLMs are "intelligent"—the Clever Hans parallel (intelligence as responsiveness to external cues, not intrinsic reasoning), the Socratic method as prompting, and Will Whitney's model-as-computer paradigm. The thread connecting these: intelligence may be relational/contextual rather than intrinsic. This has implications for how you think about AI tooling at work.

**Moral Philosophy as Framework**: Heavy philosophical reading—morality-as-cooperation (MAC) for AI alignment, critiques of Sam Harris's objective morality argument, and self-help philosophy critiques. The MAC framework proposes AGI could derive human-aligned values through cooperation dynamics rather than external constraints. Worth tracking for your AI initiative thinking.

**Political Instability & Authoritarianism**: South Korea's martial law attempt, Syria's regime collapse, analysis of Orbán's playbook being applied to American politics, and the "Great Capitulation" of tech leaders to Trump. The throughline: democratic institutions are more fragile than assumed, and elite defection accelerates decline.

**Software Philosophy**: Strong signal on throwaway code over design docs, type-driven development, and market inefficiency (why good products are rare). The Dan Luu piece on build-vs-buy is particularly relevant to your founder work—markets for lemons are everywhere.

## Knowledge & Learning

**New frameworks added:**
- **Morality as Cooperation (MAC)**: Three-part LessWrong series on cooperation-based AI alignment
- **Dynamic Multilevel Process**: Cognitive processing levels (elemental → emotional → social → intellectual)
- **Evidence Color Wheel**: Visual Bayesian reasoning without math
- **Kelly Criterion zero-variance game**: Thomas Cover's card game where Kelly betting always returns exactly 9.08x

**Notable additions:**
- René Girard's mimetic theory and its political applications (Peter Thiel studied under Girard)
- o1 technical primer: test-time scaling as the new frontier of the Bitter Lesson
- Quantum supremacy skepticism (Gil Kalai's case against Google's claims)
- Kowloon Walled City as heterotopia (Foucault applied to urban studies)
- Bonhoeffer's theological journey and resistance ethics

**Engineering content:**
- Type-driven development practices from a 300k+ LOC TypeScript codebase
- AI agent architecture with PGLite (Postgres in WebAssembly)
- Build vs buy market inefficiency analysis

## Tasks & Progress

**Completed (AI-delegated):**
- ✅ Tailsnitch audit on home Tailscale network
- ✅ Feedback email to stakeholders (Raju interview decision)
- ✅ Notion AI agent updates
- ✅ AI ROI measurement initial thoughts for Randy

**Pending work items (priority):**
- JumpRope/Aeries integration (multiple subtasks: GRD table endpoint, marking period mapping, sandbox setup)
- Employee self-reflection for performance review
- AWS cost optimization follow-up with James
- Weekly 1:1s setup with Randy for AI initiative

**Decisions needed:**
- UPLIFT standing desk purchase (sale ends 02/03)
- Mobile app approach (embedded vs standalone) for app store timelines

## Action Items

1. **This week**: Complete employee self-reflection; set up Randy 1:1 cadence
2. **January 23**: Attend Anthropic/Blackstone webinar, assess value
3. **Before Feb 3**: Decide on standing desk purchase
4. **Ongoing**: JumpRope/Aeries integration—GRD endpoint is the critical path (4-5 days estimated)
5. **Consider**: The model-as-computer paradigm for internal AI tooling discussions
6. **Low priority**: Try out DSPy, Listen Later, RealtimeVoiceChat from your backlog
