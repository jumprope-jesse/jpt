# Social Life & Community Building

## Insights from James O'Malley's Experience

### The Problem: Over-Optimized Isolation

- Remote work + comfortable home life can lead to never leaving the house
- Having friends scattered geographically doesn't equal having a community
- "Over-optimizing" life for comfort can lead to social isolation
- Close friends exist, but no regular mechanism to bring people together

### Key Insight: Community vs. Friends

Having friends is different from having a community. Community provides:
- Ready-made group of people who know each other
- Regular, low-coordination ways to see familiar faces
- Sense of belonging and identity
- Mutual support and trust-building

### Building Your Own Community

Three key ingredients:
1. **Common connection or interest** - a reason for people to gather
2. **Place for informal interaction** - somewhere to hang out
3. **Mechanism for new people to join** - prevents decay over time

### The Monthly Drinks Strategy

O'Malley's approach:
- Organize recurring monthly drinks with "the most interesting people I know"
- Curate a mailing list of friends and acquaintances
- Announce date, send invites, show up
- Continue expanding the list (engagement funnel for friendships)

This solves two problems:
1. **Coordination problem** - "I will be here, come if you're free" vs. ad-hoc planning
2. **Decay problem** - regular touchpoints prevent drifting apart

### Practical Takeaways

- **Just invite people to stuff** - it works
- Birthday drinks can be a starting point
- Don't wait for perfect conditions to organize something
- New friends can be added to recurring events
- Even loose connections can become real friendships with regular contact

### Relevance to NYC Life

- Fast-paced lifestyle can lead to superficial relationships
- Remote work compounds isolation
- Creating regular social touchpoints is especially valuable
- Consider organizing informal gatherings or meetups

## The Decline of Male Friendships

Source: [Where Have All My Deep Male Friendships Gone?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/magazine/male-friendships.html) (NYT, May 2025)

### The Statistics

- 2024 Survey Center on American Life: Only 26% of men have 6+ close friends (vs 55% in 1990)
- 17% of men now report having ZERO close friends (5x increase since 1990)
- Almost all men cite the same inflection point: marriage and kids

### Why It's Hard

The real barrier isn't time - it's energy and anxiety:
- "Byzantine bylaws" of male friendship create fear of running afoul
- Hesitant to share when suffering (don't want to seem soft/needy)
- Hesitant to reach out to struggling friends (fear of seeming intrusive)
- "Clogged quality" to interactions when hangs become sporadic
- Physical discomfort with intimacy (hugs last a millisecond)

### Historical Context (Rhaina Cohen)

Until the 20th century, emotional male friendship was normal:
- Men openly held hands, wrote passionate platonic love letters
- Lincoln to Joshua Speed: "my desire to befriend you is everlasting"
- Melville to Hawthorne: "your heart beat in my ribs and mine in yours"
- "Sentimentality was a core part of masculinity in 18th/19th centuries"

What changed: Marriage shifted from economic arrangement to romantic love. Spouse became expected soulmate, pushing friends to periphery.

### The Self-Improvement Trap

The author's journey through Goggins/Rogan-style "stay hard" culture:
- Worked out 1,000 straight days but remained lonely
- Self-improvement didn't fix the underlying need for connection
- "I was hard enough to work out for 1,000 straight days, but I still wasn't hard enough to call my friends"

### Practical Framework: TCS (Text, Call, See)

From the "Man of the Year" podcast (Aaron Karo & Matt Ritter):
- **Text weekly**
- **Call monthly**
- **See quarterly**

Key insight: "Guys forget that friendship is a relationship - it requires watering"

Other tips:
- "Be the friend" - don't wait for others to call you
- Assume your friend DOES want to hear from you (they're blocked too)
- Regular events solve the coordination problem ("I will be here, come if you're free")

### The Payoff

The author's reconnection experience:
- "Nothing extraordinary happened" - and that was the point
- Didn't need to empty souls or have transcendent conversation
- "We related on our own terms"
- Felt "free and easy... afloat in the presence of an old friend's unjudgmental love"

## Gaming as Family Connection

Source: [You should play Splatoon with your family](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075342/splatoon-3-family-bonding) (The Verge, Feb 2024)

### The Pattern: Pandemic Gaming That Never Ended

The evolution:
1. 2020: Bought Nintendo Switch, started Animal Crossing FaceTime hangouts with siblings
2. 2022: One sibling got Splatoon 3, eventually most of the family joined
3. Present: Five family members (oldest of 5 siblings + one significant other) play together several times a week

### How It Works

The ritual:
- Group chat lights up: "Splat." "Splat." "Splat."
- Everyone jumps on FaceTime
- Play Splatoon together for hours
- Developed "whole intrafamily lore" (completely incomprehensible to outsiders but hilarious to them)

### Key Insights

**Technology as connector, not isolator:**
- Author is "not what you would call a gamer"
- Plays primarily as "a way of hanging out with friends"
- Gaming becomes the excuse to connect regularly

**Low-coordination touchpoints:**
- No planning ahead - just "splat" means "I love you, let's hang out"
- Similar to the monthly drinks strategy - regular, expected time together
- Scattered family across US stays connected multiple times per week

**Shared activities create shared culture:**
- Inside jokes and lore only they understand
- Develops sense of belonging and identity within the family
- Activity matters less than the regularity and shared experience

### Relevance for Distributed Families

Solutions for staying close when geographically scattered:
- **Find a shared activity** that works remotely (gaming, watching shows together, book club)
- **Make it regular** - removes coordination burden
- **Keep it low-stakes** - no need to plan, just show up when available
- **Accept imperfect participation** - sometimes not everyone can make it, that's okay

This is essentially the same principle as monthly drinks or TCS framework, just adapted for family across time zones.
