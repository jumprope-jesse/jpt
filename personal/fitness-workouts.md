## Beginner Workout Guide

Source: [NYT - 5 Workouts for Complete Beginners](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/well/move/beginner-workout-ideas.html)

### Key Principles (Jenny Liebl, ISSA trainer)
- Start by listing reasons you want to exercise, focusing on how you want to **feel** (less tired, more limber, more energetic)
- Track how you're feeling over time (sleep quality, joint pain, energy levels)
- Use yourself as your benchmark, not others
- Consistency matters more than frequency - pick a time and stick with it
- Use the first month to explore different movements

### 5 Beginner Workouts

| Workout | Duration | Good For | Frequency |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Non-workout workout | 10 min | Building habit, morning routine | 1x/week to start |
| Mobility workout | 10 min | Everyday movements, stability | Up to 3x/week |
| Intro to Pilates | 10 min | Core strength, posture, mind-body | 1x/week to start |
| Yoga to wind down | 10 min | Relaxation, flexibility, sleep prep | Up to 3x/week |
| Balance workout | <10 min | Stability, equilibrium | 2-3x/week |

### Notes
- All workouts are 10 minutes or less
- Pilates can be done at home without equipment (no reformer needed)
- Evening yoga is good for sleep preparation
- Balance is important to maintain as you age - test yourself periodically

## Running Philosophy

### The Appropriate Amount of Effort is Zero

*Source: https://expandingawareness.org/blog/the-appropriate-amount-of-effort-is-zero/ - Added: 2026-01-18*

Counter-intuitive insight from Michael Ashcroft: the correct amount of **effort** for any task is zero. Effort = energy expended *beyond* what an activity actually requires.

**Key insight from elite athletes:**
- **Katie Ledecky (Olympic swimmer):** "I felt so relaxed...that's why it surprised me that I had...broken my world record."
- **Ryan Hall (marathon runner):** Top performers appear relaxed while struggling competitors look strained.

**Why over-effort persists:**
- "Faulty sensory appreciation" - years of excessive effort make strain feel normal
- Our senses become miscalibrated: ease feels wrong, strain feels right
- Cultural narratives around hustle reinforce the pattern

**Practical application:**
- Experiment with dropping unnecessary tension during runs
- Expect initial discomfort—reduced effort feels unfamiliar
- Look for the "sweet spot" where movement flows with elegance
- Trust that performance will still happen with less strain

Aligns with Daoist principle: "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."
