# Fitness & Workouts

## Beginner Workout Guide

Source: [NYT - 5 Workouts for Complete Beginners](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/well/move/beginner-workout-ideas.html)

### Key Principles (Jenny Liebl, ISSA trainer)
- Start by listing reasons you want to exercise, focusing on how you want to **feel** (less tired, more limber, more energetic)
- Track how you're feeling over time (sleep quality, joint pain, energy levels)
- Use yourself as your benchmark, not others
- Consistency matters more than frequency - pick a time and stick with it
- Use the first month to explore different movements

### 5 Beginner Workouts

| Workout | Duration | Good For | Frequency |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Non-workout workout | 10 min | Building habit, morning routine | 1x/week to start |
| Mobility workout | 10 min | Everyday movements, stability | Up to 3x/week |
| Intro to Pilates | 10 min | Core strength, posture, mind-body | 1x/week to start |
| Yoga to wind down | 10 min | Relaxation, flexibility, sleep prep | Up to 3x/week |
| Balance workout | <10 min | Stability, equilibrium | 2-3x/week |

### Notes
- All workouts are 10 minutes or less
- Pilates can be done at home without equipment (no reformer needed)
- Evening yoga is good for sleep preparation
- Balance is important to maintain as you age - test yourself periodically

## Running Philosophy

### Consistency Over Suffering

*Source: https://dynomight.net/2021/01/25/how-to-run-without-all-the-agonizing-pain/ - Added: 2026-01-18*

Core insight: The pain untrained runners feel almost completely disappears within a few weeks. You don't need willpower to break through—just consistency.

**Why most people quit:**
- Start too fast, body can't keep up after 1-2 minutes
- Experience cardiovascular pain (heart/lungs struggling)
- Assume this suffering is permanent and quit after a few sessions

**What trained runners actually experience:**
- Cardiovascular system adapts quickly (weeks, not months)
- Running shifts from "whole body agony" to "legs getting tired"—infinitely more pleasant
- The "crazy runners" on the street aren't suffering

**The Dynomight™ Running Program:**
1. Schedule three 20-minute sessions per week
2. Jog as long as you feel like it; when it gets hard, walk
3. Over time, increase jogging fraction naturally—don't measure, don't stress

At first, you might only manage a handful of 30-second jogs. That's fine.

**Two failure modes:**
- **Mode A (likely, harmful):** Plan too aggressive → dread sessions → quit
- **Mode B (unlikely, minor):** Plan too easy → enjoy it → improve slightly slower

Most exercise advice optimizes around Mode B (elite athletes). Regular people should optimize around Mode A.

**Key reframe:** You're starting a habit for decades. Today's intensity doesn't matter. What matters is (1) you run, and (2) you enjoy it enough to run again tomorrow.

### The Appropriate Amount of Effort is Zero

*Source: https://expandingawareness.org/blog/the-appropriate-amount-of-effort-is-zero/ - Added: 2026-01-18*

Counter-intuitive insight from Michael Ashcroft: the correct amount of **effort** for any task is zero. Effort = energy expended *beyond* what an activity actually requires.

**Key insight from elite athletes:**
- **Katie Ledecky (Olympic swimmer):** "I felt so relaxed...that's why it surprised me that I had...broken my world record."
- **Ryan Hall (marathon runner):** Top performers appear relaxed while struggling competitors look strained.

**Why over-effort persists:**
- "Faulty sensory appreciation" - years of excessive effort make strain feel normal
- Our senses become miscalibrated: ease feels wrong, strain feels right
- Cultural narratives around hustle reinforce the pattern

**Practical application:**
- Experiment with dropping unnecessary tension during runs
- Expect initial discomfort—reduced effort feels unfamiliar
- Look for the "sweet spot" where movement flows with elegance
- Trust that performance will still happen with less strain

Aligns with Daoist principle: "Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."

## Aging & Running Mindset

### Getting Older Isn't What You Think

*Source: https://www.katycowan.co.uk/blog/getting-old - Added: 2026-01-18*

Katy Cowan's reflections on aging challenge common stereotypes and reframe it as opportunity rather than decline.

**Key Themes:**
- Aging brings personal growth and wisdom—experience is an asset, not a liability
- Maturity can enhance creativity and innovation (applies to both running and software engineering)
- Balancing family life with professional ambitions requires intentional self-care
- Getting older is an opportunity for reinvention and deeper connections, not decline

**Running Connection:**
- Complements the "zero effort" philosophy—wisdom to work with your body, not against it
- Long-term athletic pursuits benefit from accumulated experience and self-knowledge
- Mental health and self-care become more important as responsibilities increase
- Age brings patience and perspective that younger runners often lack

**Life Stage Reflection:**
Relevant for navigating career, family, and fitness priorities as you age. Encourages reassessing goals and values rather than chasing youthful metrics.
