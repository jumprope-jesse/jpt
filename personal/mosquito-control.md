# Mosquito Control

DIY methods for reducing mosquito populations in the backyard without chemical sprays.

## Mosquito Bucket of Death

An effective, eco-friendly method using bacteria to kill mosquito larvae before they become adults.

### How It Works

Female mosquitoes are attracted to stagnant, fetid water to lay eggs. The bucket provides an irresistible breeding site, but the larvicide bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis / BT) kills larvae before they mature.

### Setup

**Materials:**
- 5-gallon bucket (3-5 gallon works)
- Decaying organic matter (leaves, soil, compost, grass clippings)
- A few sticks
- MosquitoDunks (available at hardware stores, ~$10-15 for 6-pack)
- Optional: hardware cloth or chicken wire + zip ties (critter escape)

**Steps:**
1. Fill bucket half full with water (non-chlorinated preferred, or let tap water sit 2 days)
2. Add 1-2 handfuls of decaying organic matter
3. Add sticks (escape path for good bugs + landing spots for mosquitoes)
4. Let sit outdoors 2-3 days to become "fetid"
5. Add **1/4 of a MosquitoDunk** (not the whole thing - lasts 30 days)
6. Place in shady areas of yard where mosquitoes congregate

**Maintenance:**
- Top off water as needed (evaporation)
- Replace MosquitoDunk portion every 30 days
- Multiple buckets = faster results (4+ recommended for typical yard)

### Timeline

- **Days 1-3**: Bucket ages and attracts mosquitoes
- **Day 5+**: Mosquito larvae appear
- **Week 2-3**: Larvae eating BT start dying
- **~1 month**: Noticeable reduction in mosquito population (existing adults must die off naturally - females live up to 6 weeks)

### Safety

- BT is harmless to pets, wildlife, and humans
- Pets can drink from the bucket safely
- No harm to beneficial insects (bees, butterflies, lightning bugs)

### Why Not Chemical Sprays?

| Factor | Bucket of Death | Chemical Sprays |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Cost | ~$15 initial + $2/month | $75-400 per visit |
| Effectiveness | Kills larvae at source | ~10% of adult mosquitoes |
| Collateral damage | None | Kills bees, butterflies, lightning bugs |
| Effort | Set and forget (monthly refresh) | Requires recurring service |

### Pro Tips

- **Dehumidifier water**: Non-chlorinated and free - perfect for filling buckets
- **Multiple buckets**: More coverage = faster population reduction
- **Start in April**: Get ahead of mosquito season (takes a month to see results)
- **Shady spots**: Mosquitoes prefer shade; place buckets accordingly
