## Cooking Philosophy & Lessons

*Source: Mister Branzino's Newsletter (21 Years, 21 Cooking Lessons) - Added: 2026-01-19*

Practical wisdom from 21 years of daily home cooking. Good reference for improving kitchen efficiency and mindset.

### Recipe Mindset
- **You're the boss of your sauce** - Recipes are guides, not gospel. Substitute freely based on preferences.
- **Wabi-sabi applies** - Embrace imperfect food. Funky-shaped tomatoes, heart-shaped pizza - it's all good.

### Planning & Efficiency
- **Fail to plan = plan to fail** - A loose plan beats no plan. You'll get overwhelmed without one.
- **Mise-en-place for speed** - Chop, measure, prep before turning on heat.
- **Clean while you cook** - Saves time and mental load for whoever's on cleanup duty.
- **Medium-high stove / 375°F oven** - The universal "good enough" temperatures for most things.

### Shopping & Ingredients
- **Grandma mindset** - Shop international/farmers markets, buy big cuts and freeze portions, adapt to what's on sale.
- **Keep parsley and lemons in fridge** - Quick elevators for any dish.
- **No price tag on quality** - Cut other spending, invest in food quality. Your 80-year-old self will thank you.

### Equipment
- **Sharp knives matter** - Dull knives are dangerous. Regular sharpening = no more crying on onions.
- **Moist paper towel under cutting board** - Stops wobbling, saves fingers.
- **Fancy equipment not required** - Buy good, inexpensive gear at restaurant supply stores.
- **Scale and thermometer essential** - Precision matters.
- **Skip the sourdough starter** - Time sink for busy people. Try a poolish instead.

### Leftovers Strategy
- **Leftovers are king** - Sunday roast chicken → Monday chicken soup → Tuesday tacos.
- Maximum benefit comes from actually using them up.

### Family Cooking
- **Marry someone with 80%+ food overlap** - Otherwise you're cooking separate meals and will burn out.
- **Not a short-order cook for kids** - Two options: take it or leave it. They won't starve.
- **Presentation matters for picky eaters** - Make food look desirable to kids.
- **Taste great food regularly** - Go out 1x/week to expand palette and learn from chefs.

### Philosophy
- **Cooking for others is about them, not you** - Navel-gazing robs connection.
- **Keep it fun** - Experiment with flavors/genres. Garbage results happen; order out and try again.
