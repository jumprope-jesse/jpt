# Marriage & Long-Term Relationship Advice

## 25 Lessons from 25 Years of Marriage

From Ferrett Steinmetz's Substack, reflecting on what's made his marriage work over 25 years.

### On Daily Kindness & Reliability

**Practical kindnesses beat romantic gestures:** Reliability is a secret weapon. Roses and dinners are spice, but the meat is: showing up when you said you would, cleaning dishes before they ask, keeping finances balanced.

**Anticipation is a necessary skill:** A good partner pays attention and acts without being asked. Taking out trash before being asked is kindness; after being asked three times is grudging. Listen beyond words.

**Thank easily and often:** Some say you shouldn't get credit for routine tasks. Counter-view: thanking someone for everyday kindnesses shows you still appreciate them. Express gratitude freely for the tiniest things.

**Stupid things can be important:** In-jokes, tiny rituals (exaggeratedly saying "Ope!" in hallways)—these define you as a couple. Don't underestimate tiny bonding moments.

### On Growing Together

**Take interest in each other's hobbies:** You don't have to be into everything they are, but cultivate enough knowledge to admire their work and geek out about highlights together.

**Growing together vs. drifting apart:** You will both change. The key is not changing in isolation. Too many couples live in separate Venn diagram circles, only overlapping for joint activities. When one changes in their isolated part, they wake up incompatible.

"If I'm not involved, I don't care" effectively says "I only love the parts of you that intersect with my needs."

**Reevaluate people periodically:** Old grievances may no longer apply. People mellow, circumstances change. Be willing to see who they are now, not who they were.

### On Communication & Conflict

**Speaking your partner's love language feels awkward:** You may never feel the internal love when doing acts of service vs. words of affirmation—but you'll see how happy they become.

**Sometimes nobody's to blame:** Flats, misinterpretations, accidental nerve-hitting. If your first goal is always "find who's to blame," you're doomed. Learn when to blame the person vs. the situation.

**"I'm sure you did":** When you trust your partner isn't gaslighting, don't fight over "who told what and when." Say "I'm sure you did tell me—I'm sorry, it slipped my mind. What can we do now?"

**Feelings are symptoms, not diagnoses:** Anger/sadness/jealousy are valid signs you're hurting. But interrogate the hurt to find true causes. You may be mad, but it could be unfair to be mad.

**But also listen to your feelings:** Don't smother feelings under layers of "that's unfair to them." Sometimes that person really is trying to drive a wedge.

**What's satisfying is rarely effective:** Cathartic righteous rages feel good; calm negotiations do good. Adults learn that a good life is full of unsatisfying compromises.

### On Arguments

**Apologize unilaterally:** Just because they said something hurtful doesn't make it okay for you to. Sometimes apologize even when they don't. (Especially important when modeling for children.)

**Only one person in the freakout tree:** One person can climb the tree to freak out while the other stays grounded to talk them down. If both are in the tree flinging coconuts, you both tumble with no one to catch either.

Explicitly asking "Hey, can I have the tree?" has saved their bacon more than once.

**Productive arguments are collaborative:**
- Bad argument: everyone walks away with same opinions
- Good argument: people come away with usable information

Rules: You're trying to figure out how your partner works. They're trying to figure out how you work. Any new information = winning.

**Allow takebacks:** Words are hard during disputes. If someone says something really hurtful and tries to walk it back, give space to explore what they wanted to say, not their exact misstatement.

**Never settle arguments on the Internet:** Hard to present things accurately; friends circle wagons; strangers suggest DUMP THAT S.O.B. Talk to friends/family/therapists—don't crowdsource disputes.

### On Support & Independence

**Don't support people who don't support your relationship:** Sometimes friends are right to warn you. Other times they're toxic and jealous. If someone undermines your relationship for selfish reasons, drop them.

**Hold dialogues, not monologues:** If you're pacing and practicing your big angry speech where they patiently agree and beg forgiveness... that never happens. Don't bother.

**Know when you're cheating:** Cheating isn't just physical—it's emotional, breaking agreements, keeping secrets. When you do something and think "I better make sure my partner never finds out," the first thing to do is make sure they find out.

### On Respect & Understanding

**You don't have to understand it to respect it:** A cis person may not feel gender dysphoria but can still respect a trans friend. Your partner may have ADHD, chronic illness, or different social needs you don't experience.

Refusing to accommodate unless their experience matches yours—or accusing them of faking for attention—is monstrous. "They walk a different path; you may never step foot on it, but for God's sake, at least read the map."

### On Recharging & Humor

**Lean into introvert habits:** It took them embarrassingly long to realize they recharge by razzing tattoo artists on "Ink Master." Whatever you need for downtime is what you need. Don't let outside influences factor in.

**Like is more important than love:** How much you like vs. love someone are separate scales. Without a sea of positive "likes," the relationship tumbles into quiet dread—groaning at shared responsibilities, bracing for their thoughtless jokes.

Accentuate "like" at every opportunity.

**A sense of humor is a secret weapon:** You're gonna have worst things happen. If you can laugh at them, no matter how bad, it helps you survive.

**When all seems lost, go see a movie:** If you're trapped in a bad patch going over the same hurts, do something that reminds you why you liked each other. Remind yourself what you're fighting for.

## The Snack Support Dynamic (Humor)

From The Onion's satirical take on everyday relationship dynamics:

**The Scene:** Husband hovers silently in front of open refrigerator. Wife immediately puts down novel and begins calling out suggestions: "Crackers? An apple? Toast? Do you want toast? It's easy to make toast. You could put butter on it. Do you want a cheese stick? We have cheese sticks. Enchiladas? They're in the back of the fridge. You don't have to have a whole one, you could just cut one in half. Lunch meat? Do you want some loose ham?"

**The Resolution:** Woman pours Goldfish crackers into bowl and ushers husband back to office.

**Why it resonates:** The humor highlights a common dynamic—one partner taking on the mental load of household management, including the seemingly trivial decision of what to snack on. It's a gentle satire of:
- Decision fatigue in modern life
- The invisible labor of running a household
- How partners often take on complementary roles (decision-maker vs. executor)
- The mundanity of daily life punctuated by small acts of care
