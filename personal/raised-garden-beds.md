# Raised Garden Beds

Guide to raised garden bed options for urban/small-space gardening and family projects.

## Why Raised Beds

- **Soil control**: Fill with nutrient-rich blend, avoid contaminated urban soil (lead, etc.)
- **Extended growing season**: Warm up quickly in spring, cool slowly in fall
- **Reduced weeds**: Frame acts as buffer, easier to maintain edges
- **No soil compaction**: Kids/feet won't accidentally compact the planting area
- **Space efficiency**: Dense planting, no walkways needed
- **Family activity**: Great intro to gardening for kids, teaches responsibility and nature connection

## Considerations for Urban/Small Spaces

- Rooftop compatibility (weight, drainage)
- Compact footprints for small yards/patios
- Elevated beds for balconies or accessibility needs
- Storage/assembly in tight spaces

### DIY Option: Oldcastle Planter Wall Blocks + Cedar Lumber
**Price**: ~$390 for 4'x8'x12" (using quality cedar) | **Blocks**: ~$4 each

**Pros:**
- Custom sizes - L-shaped, U-shaped, tiered configurations possible
- No drill required
- Expandable later
- Endlessly modular

**Cons:**
- No cost savings if using quality cedar lumber
- Requires level surface (no hardware to compensate)
- Blocks only fit finished 2x6 boards (1.5"x5.5" actual)
- May need rebar reinforcement for stability

**Note**: Cheap lumber (pine/fir) costs ~$100 but rots in ~5 years. Quality cedar negates savings vs kits.

### Detailed Oldcastle Assembly Guide

From [Wirecutter's Oldcastle deep-dive](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/oldcastle-wall-blocks-raised-garden-bed/):

**Why People Love These:**
- ~$3 per block at Home Depot/Lowe's
- 4 blocks + 4 boards = under $50 for a basic bed (the same day!)
- IKEA-level simple: no power tools, no drilling, no screws
- Soil weight seats everything in place

**Materials Checklist:**
- Oldcastle planter wall blocks (4 minimum, stack up to 3 high)
- 2-by-6 lumber for 6" depth, 2-by-12 for 12" depth
- Landscaping fabric and/or chicken wire (optional, for weeds/pests)
- Rebar and landscape block adhesive (optional, for stability)
- Rubber mallet, tape measure, level, shovel

**Shape Flexibility:**
- Every block side has a slot - build L-shapes, U-shapes, tiered
- Calculate reach span (wingspan) to determine bed width
- Can add sections to existing beds later

**Assembly Steps:**
1. Level the ground (or dig shallow furrows for boards to seat in)
2. Place blocks at measured intervals for corners
3. Slot wood into blocks
4. Add liner (fabric/chicken wire) if needed
5. Fill with soil - weight locks everything together

**Pro Tips:**
- Double-check wood/block fit at store (even slightly thick boards won't fit)
- Seat boards ~½" into ground to prevent water leakage
- Cardboard on bottom smothers weeds and decomposes over time
- Drive rebar through block holes for reinforcement
- Use landscape adhesive between stacked blocks
- Block holes double as anchor points for trellises, PVC mesh covers, or solar lights
- Add 2-by-8 lumber toppers for polished look (screws required)

**Wood Choice:**
- Pressure-treated: Lasts longer, modern chemicals considered safe (arsenic banned 2003)
- Untreated cedar: Naturally rot-resistant, ~20 year lifespan
- Untreated pine: Budget option, ~5-10 year lifespan

**Soil Calculator:** [Calculate cubic feet needed](https://www.gardeners.com/how-to/soil-calculator/7558.html)

## Soil Depth Requirements

| Depth | Suitable Plants |
|-------|-----------------|
| 10-12" | Herbs, lettuce, radishes, strawberries |
| 15" | Most vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant - with support) |
| 17"+ | Tomatoes, kale, peppers (comfortable root space) |
| 18"+ | Deep-rooted: zucchini, rhubarb |

## Tips

- **Weed suppression**: Line bottom with landscaping fabric or cardboard
- **Contaminated soil**: Use landscaping fabric as barrier; cardboard decomposes and lets roots grow deeper
- **Watering**: Raised beds dry faster than in-ground - heavy mulch helps retain moisture
- **Hot climates**: Choose light-colored metal beds or wooden options
- **4' max width**: Standard for reaching center without stepping in bed
- **Lasagna method**: Layer natural materials to reduce soil needed (finish with 6" soil on top)

## Materials Comparison

| Material | Lifespan | Soil Temp | Maintenance | Cost |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Cedar | 10-15 yrs | Neutral | Low | $$$ |
| Metal (ZAM/Aluzinc) | 20+ yrs | Warmer | None | $$ |
| Galvanized steel | 10-15 yrs | Warmer | Low | $ |
| Pine/fir | ~5 yrs | Neutral | Replacement | $ |

## Container Alternative: Behrens Galvanized Steel Tubs

An affordable option for container gardening using repurposed farm/utility tubs.

### Why Steel Tubs

- **Durability**: Galvanized steel with zinc coating resists rust and all weather conditions
- **Aesthetics**: Charming farmhouse look vs typical plastic pots
- **Cost**: Under $30 each for large sizes (17-gallon)
- **Portability**: Easy to move trees/shrubs indoors for winter or reposition for light
- **Versatility**: Control soil mix, companion plant around trees, adapt to changing needs

### Available Sizes

| Type | Capacity | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| Square tubs | Various | Smaller plants, herbs |
| Bushels | ~2 ft diameter | Citrus trees, roses, peonies |
| 17-gallon round tubs | Large | Shrubs, dwarf fruit trees, mints |

### Setup

1. Drill 8-12 drainage holes in bottom
2. Clean thoroughly with soap and water
3. Plant and enjoy

### Pros

- Survive heat waves, snow, ice, rain year-round
- Affordable enough to stock up on multiple sizes
- Trees in containers allow soil control and easy repositioning
- Good for companion planting (herbs around fruit trees for pest control)

### Cons

- **Labels**: Large stickers are difficult to remove (rubbing alcohol helps)
- **Handles**: Small and thin, uncomfortable when full - consider comfort grip covers
- **Heat**: Metal can overheat plants in very hot climates (PNW reports no issues; may be problematic in hotter regions with extended 90°F+ stretches)
- **Limited availability**: Some sizes hard to find - buy multiples when you find them

### Food Safety

Behrens states zinc-coated galvanized tubs are safe for fruits and vegetables **if in good condition**. Regularly check for significant deterioration, as damaged metal could leach toxins.

### Comparison to Raised Beds

| Factor | Steel Tubs | Raised Beds |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Portability | Moveable | Fixed |
| Soil volume | Limited | Large |
| Best for | Trees, shrubs, container plants | Vegetable gardens |
| Cost per plant | Lower upfront | Higher upfront, more plants |
| Aesthetics | Farmhouse/rustic | Clean/structured |
