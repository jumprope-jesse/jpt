## AI Financial Advisory Services

A new wave of flat-fee AI-powered financial advisors is disrupting the traditional "1% of AUM" model.

### The Model Shift
- **Traditional**: Pay 1% of assets annually (min $500k relationship) - bundled with asset management
- **New**: Flat fees ($100/mo or ~$2,500 one-time) for actual financial planning advice

### Services to Evaluate

#### Domain Money
- **URL**: https://domainmoney.com
- **Pricing**: $2,500 flat fee for comprehensive financial plan
- **Focus**: Financial planning separate from asset management
- **Target audience**: People who already use roboadvisors (Betterment, Wealthfront) for investments but need planning help
- **Quote**: "The size of your portfolio has no bearing on the amount of work I'm going to do"

#### Fifr
- **URL**: TBD
- **Founder**: Daniel Alfi
- **Model**: Flat-fee advisory
- **Thesis**: "AI will make it radically cheaper on a per-client basis to serve people"

#### Other Players
- **Facet** - Flat-fee financial planning
- **Range** - Flat-fee advisory
- **Playbook** - Flat-fee model

### Why This Matters for HENRYs
- "High Earners, Not Rich Yet" have been underserved
- Traditional advisors gravitate toward wealthy clients
- Complex needs: tax-advantaged savings, employee stock plans, "how much can I afford to spend"
- Upfront fee often pays for itself in tax optimization alone

### Key Insight
Most people under 55 don't need quarterly advisor meetings. A well-constructed financial plan can last years until circumstances change. The "regular check-ins" model was built for $5M+ portfolios.

## Considerations
- Need a tool that handles both family budget and startup finances
- Integration capabilities matter (bank connections, etc.)
- Privacy/security important for financial data
- Apple Shortcuts approach is privacy-focused but requires manual entry
