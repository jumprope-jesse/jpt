## Early Reading: Teaching Toddlers with Anki

A structured approach to teaching reading to toddlers (starting ~2 years old) using spaced repetition and decodable content.

### Phase 1: Letters (Age ~2)

**Letter Names & Sounds:**
- Start with alphabet song + [Letter Sounds song from Reading Bear](https://readingbear.org)
- Magnet letters on fridge for hands-on play
- Add Anki flashcards for each letter:
  - Draw big colorful letter on one side
  - Picture + recorded audio of letter name/sound on reverse
  - Use simple phonetic examples (A = apple, not ape; X = box, not xylophone)
  - Personalize with family photos (M = Mama)

**Anki Settings for Toddlers:**
- Max 10 reviews per day
- Add only 2 new cards per day
- Keep sessions short - let them wander away if bored
- Verify recognition even with poor pronunciation ("N is for n... n..." → "narwhal!")
- Start with uppercase, add lowercase later with same pictures

### Phase 2: Words (After letters mastered)

**Word Sources:**
- [Reading Bear word list](https://readingbear.org) (Appendix A in Teacher's Guide)
- Add personalized words: child's name, family names, favorite animals

**Progression:**
- Make 10-20 new cards per batch from Reading Bear list
- Add 2 new cards per day
- Teach new phonics concepts before they appear in reviews
- Enable FSRS in Anki for efficiency
- If concept is easy → suspend upcoming cards, move on
- If concept is hard → add more cards, slow down

**Common Issues:**
- b/d confusion: Use "bed" flashcard with hand gestures (left hand = b, right hand = d)

### Phase 3: Sentences & Decodable Books

**Key Principles:**
- Minimize exception words (don't use "the", "from", "I" until memorized in Anki)
- Keep sentences short (~5 words to start)
- Sound out ONE word at a time, not all letters in phrase
- Medium-long phonetic words are OK; exception words only if: few of them, make story interesting, you help with them

**Writing Decodable Books:**
- Write/illustrate on printer paper
- Example first book: "The lion got a gift" (only exceptions: "lion", "the")
- Laminate and bind with keyrings for durability
- Commercial decodable books (All About Reading) are OK but homemade ones personalized to child's interests work better

### Token Incentive System (Age ~2.5+)

Wooden tokens with (1) marked in Sharpie, stored in labeled jar.

**Earning:**
- 2 tokens for completing Anki reviews
- 1 token per sentence/hard book page (or per 2 easy pages)

**Spending (5 min TV per token baseline):**
| Show | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Numberblocks/Alphablocks | 1 token/5 min | Subsidized - highly educational |
| Between the Lions | 3 tokens/25 min | Subsidized |
| Pokemon, Avatar, Winnie the Pooh | 5 tokens/25 min | Standard rate |
| Wile E. Coyote | 3 tokens/7 min | Taxed for brainrot |

**Extension uses:** Tooth brushing behavior, other good behavior, redeemable for money (25¢ each)

### Resources

- **Numberblocks** - Pedagogical masterpiece for math, 5-min episodes, great incentive currency
- **Alphablocks** - Same format for letters/phonics
- **Reading Bear** - Free phonics resources and word lists
- **AnkiDroid** - Easy to make cards on phone with Draw functionality

### Results & Philosophy

By age 3.5 with ~15 min/day:
- Child reading decodable books fluently
- Tries to read words in the wild
- Proud and independent ("I can read it ALL BY MYSELF!")

Key approach: Keep it voluntary, short, and fun. Never force it. TV incentives are "brute force" but effective. No strong opinion on long-term trajectory, but enables earlier shared reading enjoyment.

### Case Study: CoffeePie's Results with Two Children

A father (reddit user caffeine314, former physics professor) used Anki from age 2 with daughter and 1yr 9mo with son. Results are striking:

**Daughter (started age 2):**
- By age 5: mechanical reading at 5th-8th grade level (5-9 years ahead)
- By age 7: mechanical reading at high school level
- Reading comprehension in Kindergarten tested at 4th grade
- Uses Anki daily for English, Hebrew, and Spanish
- Reads with "context" and expression, not mechanically

**Son (started age 1yr 9mo):**
- Knew multiplication tables to 12x12 by age 3
- By kindergarten: prime factorization, Fibonacci sequences, fractions, light algebra

**Key Lessons from Their Experience:**

1. **Lowercase letters**: Don't hold back - kids learn them passively from environment (signs, books, TV). Start lowercase immediately after uppercase.

2. **Unexpected benefits**: Early reading opened up *everything* - politics, current events, history. 4-year-old learning about council members from junk mail.

3. **Push gently, stop readily**: "Ready to stop at any moment" mentality. Both kids handled more than expected "with grace."

4. **Natural stopping point**: Around age 7-8, Anki runs its course for reading. Mechanical skill outpaces comprehension (which requires life experience). Daughter occasionally doesn't know idioms like "cold shoulder."

5. **What Anki can't teach**: Reading comprehension, number sense ("thinking of 87-8 as 80-1"). These need experience and practice problems, not flashcards.

6. **Framing as "job"**: When daughter resisted, compromise + framing as "everyone has a job, Anki is yours" worked.

7. **Backing off**: Stopped weekday Anki when homework increased in 2nd grade. "I wanted her to be a kid."

**Current approach (ages ~5 and ~8):**
- Daughter: Hebrew Anki on weekends/holidays only
- Both: Advanced math concepts framed as "hey, I have something interesting to show you" not worksheets
- Let curiosity drive learning - she has the tools to follow interests

**Caveat**: Father was a physics professor - genetic confounders likely.

## Silly Tech: FartScrollLid

A macOS app that plays fart sounds as you open/close your MacBook lid. Uses the internal lid angle sensor for pitch modulation (deep bass when closed, high squeaks when open).

**Why kids love it:**
- Instant giggles - universal fart humor
- Interactive cause-and-effect (lid angle → sound pitch)
- Great for breaking up homework time or long car trips with laptop

**Features:**
- Motion-activated (only farts when lid is moving)
- Real-time angle/velocity display
- Funny status messages ("Maximum pressure!", "Gas escaping!")

**Requirements:** macOS 11.5+, MacBook with lid angle sensor, sense of humor

**Not for:** business meetings, libraries, first dates

GitHub: https://github.com/iannuttall/fartscroll-lid

## Apps: AI Storybook Creation

### Gemini App - AI Storybooks
Google's Gemini app includes a feature for creating AI-generated storybooks with illustrations for kids.

**Potential uses:**
- Create personalized stories featuring your child's name, interests, or family
- Generate custom bedtime stories on any topic
- Teaching coding/digital literacy concepts through storytelling
- Bond with kids by bringing their story ideas to life as illustrated books

**Considerations:**
- Balance with traditional books and non-digital reading
- Good opportunity to discuss AI and how it works with older kids
- Could be a fun collaborative activity (child provides ideas, parent helps refine prompts)

Website: https://blog.google/products/gemini/storybooks/

## Screen-Free Activities: Offline.Kids

## Communication: Tin Can Phone

A "telephone club" designed for kids during the no-smartphone years. Allows voice-to-voice communication without screen exposure.

**How it works:**
- Only approved contacts can call the Tin Can device
- Parents manage allowed contacts via companion app
- Tin Can-to-Tin Can calls are free
- Party Line Plan ($9.99/mo) enables calls to regular phone numbers + 911

**Why it's compelling:**
- Gives kids independence to call friends/family without borrowing parent's phone
- No screens, games, or apps to distract
- Teaches traditional phone etiquette (answering, taking messages, conversation skills)
- Peace of mind for parents - kids can reach them or 911 when home alone
- Delays smartphone demand by fulfilling core communication need
- Can build neighborhood networks (multiple families using Tin Cans together)

**What parents report:**
- 6-10 year olds setting up their own playdates
- Kids calling grandparents daily without prompting
- Less smartphone nagging ("no longer asks about getting a cell phone")
- Learning social skills through voice-only conversations (vs. FaceTime watching each other)
- Community building among families in the network

**Considerations:**
- Best value when other families in your network also have Tin Cans (free calls)
- Doesn't prepare kids for modern communication tools (texting, video calls)
- May feel limiting if child's friends primarily use smartphones
- Requires buy-in from extended family/friends to be useful

**Good fit if:**
- Want to delay smartphone but need kids reachable
- Value voice conversation over texting
- Have neighborhood or family network interested in joining
- Kids are 6-10 and showing interest in social independence

## Baby Monitoring: AI-Powered Local Solution

### AI Baby Monitor (Local Video-LLM)
Open-source baby monitor that uses local video LLMs to watch a video stream against customizable safety rules.

**How it works:**
- Watches video stream (webcam, RTSP camera, etc.) continuously
- Compares against natural-language safety rules you define
- Issues gentle beep when rule is broken (not overwhelming alerts)
- All processing runs locally - no cloud dependency, full privacy

**Key Features:**
- **Local LLMs**: Uses vLLM for inference - data stays on your network
- **Multi-room support**: Add configs for each room, spawn watchers per room
- **Live dashboard**: Streamlit-based real-time monitoring (accessible on phone)
- **Customizable rules**: Natural language instructions in YAML config
- **Swappable models**: Change LLM via environment variable

**Example config (`configs/living_room.yaml`):**
```yaml
name: "living_room"
camera:
  uri: "0"  # webcam index or RTSP URI
instructions:
  - "The baby shouldn't do anything dangerous."
  - "An adult should be in the room if the baby is awake."
```

**Architecture:**
1. `stream_to_redis.py` - captures frames → Redis (realtime + subsampled queues)
2. `run_watcher.py` - pulls frames → encodes with instructions → LLM → JSON response → beep if `should_alert = True`
3. Streamlit dashboard - live frame + LLM logs

**Setup:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeenolife/ai-baby-monitor.git && cd ai-baby-monitor
cp .env.template .env
docker compose up --build -d
# Sound runs on host (Docker sound propagation is painful)
uv run scripts/run_watcher.py --config-file configs/living_room.yaml
# Dashboard at http://localhost:8501 or http://{host_ip}:8501 on phone
```

**Important caveats:**
- NOT a substitute for adult supervision - additional safety measure only
- Gentle beep design assumes you're nearby, just momentarily distracted
- Experimental hobby tool - use responsibly

**Why this approach:**
- Privacy-first: no cloud cameras sending video externally
- Customizable: adapt rules to your family's specific needs
- Self-hosted: aligns with tech independence philosophy
- Natural language rules: no coding needed to adjust safety criteria

**Considerations:**
- Requires decent hardware for local LLM inference
- Counter-argument: tech reliance could breed complacency - this supplements, doesn't replace, active supervision
- Sound notification runs on host, not in Docker (limitation)

### Why This Could Work for NYC Families

**Educational value:**
- AI-powered species identification teaches biology/ecology
- Real-time wildlife documentation sparks curiosity
- Hands-on ecosystem building (what attracts what, food chains)
- Conversations about pollinators, sustainability, urban nature

**Urban living benefits:**
- Creates mini-ecosystem on balcony or small outdoor space
- Brings nature closer when parks aren't accessible
- Solar-powered = low maintenance

**Kid engagement:**
- Checking app together for daily wildlife discoveries
- Building/customizing habitat blocks
- Nature "documentary" feature makes it feel like a TV show
- Photo evidence of what visited overnight

### Considerations

- **Cost**: Full setup gets pricey ($300-500 range)
- **Counter-argument**: Some might argue relying on tech to appreciate nature detracts from genuine observation - worth balancing with non-tech nature time
- **Space**: Even small balcony setup needs some outdoor space
- **Timeline**: Preorder now, delivery mid-2026

**Good fit if:** Want to foster nature connection for kids in urban environment, interested in citizen science / wildlife documentation, have outdoor space (even small).

**Makerspace integration:**
- NYC has several makerspaces (NYC Resistor, Fat Cat Fab Lab, etc.)
- Skill trees can guide what to explore there
- Some trees specifically designed for makerspace environments

**Teaching responsibility:**
- Kids can set their own goals in the blank tiles
- Ownership over what they want to learn
- Mix required skills with chosen interests

### How to Use

1. Print tree in A4 or A3 size
2. Start at bottom (basics), work up
3. Color in tiles as you complete skills
4. Interpret goals flexibly - everyone's journey differs
5. Not completionist - meant to inspire, not pressure

### Creating Custom Trees

Web app: https://schme16.github.io/MakerSkillTrees/

### Why This Works

Gamifies skill development without screens. Visual progress tracking appeals to kids. Flexible enough to personalize. Covers everything from traditional crafts to modern tech. Good conversation starter about what skills matter and why.

**Balanced view:** Some kids may find structured tracking constraining rather than motivating. Follow the child's lead - if they're not into it, don't force it.

## Creative Bedtime & Dinner Games (Ages 3-5)

Playful rule variations to make parenting routines engaging rather than boring. From Kid Quest Substack.

### Philosophy

"All the rules are culture and all recent culture—you can decide to do Something Else Instead."

The idea: instead of following expected childcare practices by rote, make up New Rules every day. Makes routines stimulating for both parent and child.

### Dinner Games

Use a "significant act of mastication" rule—each kid only gets a turn in the game if they take a real bite. Calibrated incentives for Clean Plate Club membership.

**Jenga**
- Everyone can participate, good attention grabber
- Key adjustments: Find the loose blocks for kids, let them pull; plausibly throw yourself under the bus for giggles

**Tangram**
- Puzzles on easy mode
- Colored sets let you assign colors to place according to patterns
- Go ham with geometric Rorschach - discuss shapes, "what's the minimally viable unidinocornasaurus?"

**Memory as Storytelling Device**
- Games without winners/losers preference + desire to play Memory = this
- Take turns drawing cards, tell a story based on the card
- Next person draws new card, continues story with their item/creature
- Place cards in a row to see story unfold
- Feel free to help with storytelling, nudge narrative toward exciting plot points
- Successes: items inexplicably falling from sky, everything being magic, playing die-revive ping pong with protagonist "Tomato-Butterfly-Spoon-Girl"

### Bedtime Rules (Ages 5-6)

These cover: putting on pajamas, brushing teeth, going to bathroom, book reading.

**Magic Time**
- Kiddo is the parent, you are the kiddo
- Except: kiddo still brings themselves to bed
- They tell you what to do and take care of you—you listen
- Perform obstructive behavior and misunderstand basic instructions
- Most popular game; shows insight into how child would prefer to be parented

**Simon Says**
- "Simon says" before every instruction for each bedtime step
- Include things like walking backwards to bathroom, hopping on one leg
- Both of you have to follow all instructions

**Magic Hat**
- Person wearing hat invents instruction for other person
- Other person keeps performing instruction until kiddo finishes next bedtime step
- Then swap hat. Rinse and repeat.
- Favorite instruction: kiddo turning full circle before saying anything → befuddlement and giggles

**One Hand**
- Kiddo holds one hand behind back
- Figure out how to get changed, brush teeth, bathroom like that
- Top 3 favorite—challenges them in new ways

**Balance Card**
- Balance credit card sized item on head while doing tasks
- Surprisingly good for posture

**Everything All At Once**
- Brush teeth while sitting on toilet while having book read to them
- "This rule was terrible, everyone agreed it was terrible"
- Very teachable moment about Not Multitasking

**Plushy Ping Pong**
- Pick a plushy, give it to you
- For each bedtime step, they pause and make catching motion
- Throw plushy to them, they throw it back
- Must do another step to get another back-and-forth
- Interesting: kiddo becomes aware of how tasks decompose—light switches and single steps all become "tasks" deserving Plushy Ping Pong

**Balance Hand**
- Pick challenging object to balance on hand (empty water bottle, pen)
- You keep it balanced while they do tasks
- They keep it balanced when walking between tasks

**Frozen Riddles**
- One frozen, one moving
- Kiddo goes through routine when moving, freezes mid-action when frozen
- Unfrozen person asks frozen person questions
- Frozen person can pass questions; when they get one right, roles reverse
- Your chance to quiz kid on anything! Be ready to explain why the universe exists.

**Reversal**
- Any bedtime routine piece that can be reversed, should be
- Pajamas, order of operations, numbers counted up/down, caps screwed on/off
- Interesting to see young minds grapple with reversing actions along dimensions (time, place, orientation)

**Frozen Music**
- Play a song they like
- Song keeps going as long as they keep moving through routine
- Stop/distracted → pause song; continue again → press play
- Broke speed records—keep on hand for tired days

**Tangled Tails**
- Loosely tie long scarf around kiddo's middle (comes loose under tension)
- Wrap other end around your middle/waistband
- Kiddo moves through entire routine while tied to you
- Retie when it comes loose
- Top 3 favorite—surprisingly popular

### Why This Works

- Mental stimulation for parent above pay grade of 3-5 year olds
- Variety keeps routines from getting stale
- Games without winners/losers promote teamwork and storytelling
- Provides insight into children's thinking and preferences
- Makes "tasks" into collaborative play

**Alternative view:** Some argue structured routines are essential for discipline and stability. These methods might not work for kids who need more predictability. But experimenting with different approaches can lead to memorable experiences.

## Physical Play: SoftScape Big Block Set

Giant foam building blocks for toddlers and young children - large enough for kids to build structures almost as big as themselves.

### Product Details

- **Brand:** Factory Direct Partners (SoftScape)
- **Set size:** 12 pieces
- **Block types:** 3 shapes and sizes (chunky, brightly-colored)
- **Material:** Soft foam - safe for stacking and knocking down
- **Ages:** Toddlers and young children

### Why It's Valuable

**Motor skill development:**
- Fine motor: gripping, positioning, balancing blocks
- Gross motor: reaching, stacking, carrying large blocks
- Safe "knock down" play - no hard surfaces or sharp edges

**Creative & cognitive benefits:**
- Open-ended play without instructions or "right answers"
- Introduces basic engineering concepts (balance, weight distribution, structural stability)
- Encourages spatial reasoning and planning
- Mix and match with other sets for larger builds

**Family bonding:**
- Collaborative building projects
- Opportunity to introduce concepts like design thinking, engineering, architecture
- Low-pressure shared play time

### Considerations

- **Space:** Large blocks need storage space and play area
- **Shipping:** Ships separately from other items, cannot ship to P.O. Box, not eligible for expedited shipping
- **Returns:** 30 days for unused items in original packaging with all materials
- **Balance:** Consider mixing structured play (blocks) with unstructured play time

**Alternative perspective:** Some argue open-ended toys like blocks are more developmentally valuable than toys with predetermined purposes - blocks let kids create their own rules and narratives.

## DIY Projects: Plane Radar for Toddlers

A parent built a custom plane radar for their toddler who loves planes - blending engineering skills with hands-on parenting.

### Why This Matters

**Fostering interests through tech:**
- Following the child's interests (planes) and enhancing with technology
- Shows how creativity + engineering can serve parenting
- Creates lasting memories and strengthens parent-child bond

**Play-based learning:**
- Technology can enhance learning experiences when thoughtfully applied
- Real-time data (flight tracking) makes abstract concepts concrete
- Curiosity-driven exploration vs passive screen time

**Balance considerations:**
- Screen time implications: active engagement (tracking planes) vs passive consumption
- Importance of balancing tech projects with outdoor play
- Using tech to support interests, not replace hands-on experiences

### Connection to Parenting Philosophy

**Links to "good enough" parenting:**
- Not about building the "perfect" educational tool
- About meeting child where they are and amplifying their joy
- Authenticity and connection matter more than perfection

**Links to work-life integration:**
- Bringing professional engineering skills into family life
- Modeling problem-solving and creative thinking for children
- Shows kids that parents' work skills can create meaningful things

### Personal Reflection

Questions to consider:
- What are my child's passionate interests right now?
- How can I use my skills to enhance those interests without over-engineering?
- What's the line between enriching play and adding unnecessary tech?
- How can technology projects create shared experiences vs isolate?

**Alternative view:** Some may argue this introduces screens/tech too early. Worth considering: is this active engagement (child directing, asking questions) or passive consumption? The difference matters.

- Builds foundation before text-heavy coding

**For older kids (9-12):**
- Independent exploration and modification
- Use as stepping stone to Python Tutor or other tools
- Understanding game mechanics through code
- Creating variations of existing games

**Family projects:**
- Modify games together
- Challenge: "Can you make tic-tac-toe bigger?"
- Compare to Scratch (blocks vs text code)
- Discuss data privacy and local-first software

### Limitations & Considerations

- **Browser dependency**: Clearing browser data deletes everything (backup important!)
- **Limited scope**: 5 games - not a full curriculum
- **Text-based Python**: Steeper learning curve than Scratch for younger kids
- **No community features**: Can't share creations or see others' work

**Balanced view:** This is a **starting point**, not a complete learning path. Complements visual tools like Scratch. Best for kids who've shown interest in "real" programming or who find Scratch limiting.

### Comparison to Other Tools

| Tool | Ages | Format | Complexity | Community |
|------|------|--------|------------|-----------|
| **PyKidos** | 8-12 | Text-based Python | Medium | None (local-only) |
| **Scratch** | 6-16 | Block-based | Low-Medium | Large, active |
| **Python Tutor** | 10+ | Text-based (multiple langs) | Medium-High | Visualization-focused |
| **Code.org** | 4-18+ | Mixed (blocks → text) | Scaffolded | Huge, curriculum-based |

**PyKidos sweet spot:** Kids ready for text code but not ready for full IDE complexity. Transition tool between Scratch and "real" Python.

### Getting Started

1. Visit https://pykidos.github.io/
2. Start with Tutorial (0)
3. Try Checkerboard - simple, visual, forgiving
4. Experiment: "What if I change the emoji?"
5. Progress to Disc, then Tic-tac-toe
6. Backup code regularly with Download button

**Parent tip:** Sit with child for first session. PyKidos doesn't hold hands - kids need guidance initially.

### Links to Other Interests

- **Game of Life**: Connects to cellular automata, emergence, math patterns
- **Tic-tac-toe**: Game theory, strategy, AI (could build simple opponent)
- **Privacy focus**: Teaching moment about data ownership, local-first software
- **Cyrille Rossant**: Prolific open-source contributor - model of building for learning

## Humor: Dad Jokes Collection

A curated collection of dad jokes for family bonding moments.

**Why dad jokes work:**
- Light, pun-based humor accessible to all ages
- Great for breaking tension, lightening moods
- Predictable format makes kids feel smart when they "get it"
- Easy to remember and repeat (kids love telling jokes back)

**Uses:**
- Dinner table conversation starters
- Car ride entertainment
- Bedtime routine wind-down
- Team meeting ice-breakers (work context)

**NYC angle:** Can integrate local references (subway jokes, pizza puns) to make them more relatable for NYC kids.
