### Core Principles

1. **Function first** - Each item should serve a purpose; consider both size and function
2. **Multipurpose pieces** - Storage beds, bookshelf dividers pull double duty
3. **Scale matters** - Avoid oversized furniture; tall pieces with small footprints draw eye up
4. **Use wall space** - Wall-mounted storage creates space while decluttering
