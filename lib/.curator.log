[2026-01-18 21:05:30] === Starting Knowledge Curation (DRY RUN) ===
[2026-01-18 21:05:30] Recent changes: 116 files
[2026-01-18 21:05:30] Found 76 topic clusters across 113 files
[2026-01-18 21:05:30] Asking Claude for curation recommendations...
[2026-01-18 21:05:55] Recommendations: Create aws/ and ai/ subfolders for large clusters (17 and 12 files respectively), merge related type checker and MCP files, and reorganize python/django content. Keep most other clusters flat as they're below the 5-file threshold.
