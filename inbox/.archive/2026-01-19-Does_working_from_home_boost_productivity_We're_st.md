# Does working from home boost productivity? We're starting to get answers

## AI Summary (from Notion)
- Main Question: Does working from home (WFH) increase or decrease productivity?
- Context: Nearly four years into the remote work experiment, research is beginning to provide insights.
- Key Findings:
- A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found no meaningful effect on productivity across 43 industries during the pandemic.
- A separate working paper focused on one Fortune 500 company revealed mixed outcomes related to mentorship and productivity.
- Close proximity in the office fostered mentorship but reduced short-term productivity, especially among senior coders.
- Once remote work began, the mentorship gap closed, and junior workers who received early mentorship were more likely to get raises.
- Higher quit rates were noted among close-together workers during the pandemic, indicating better opportunities available for them.
- Adaptation: Companies began hiring better-trained talent as remote work became the norm, suggesting an adjustment in business strategies.
- Implications: Productivity measurement is complex, particularly in knowledge work where outputs are less tangible.
- Overall Importance: Understanding productivity in the context of remote work is crucial for economic and business health.

Two new papers out last week shed light on one of the big questions of the remote work era: Does working from home make you more or less productive?

Driving the news: Nearly four years into the start of the country's remote experiment, we're starting to get some answers.

Why it matters: Increasing productivity is good for the economy and for businesses.

The first paper, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, looked across 43 industries in the private sector to see if more remote-friendly occupations saw increased productivity during the pandemic period.

- They didn't find any meaningful effect.
Another report, a working paper from economists at the New York Fed, University of Virginia and Harvard, looks at just one unnamed Fortune 500 company and found more nuanced answers.

- Before the pandemic, software engineers at this company either worked all together in one building — one team in close proximity — or were more dispersed across buildings, a system that more closely mimics a WFH environment.
- Researchers looked at the differences between teams before and after the pandemic.
What they found: Working close together boosts mentorship, but may decrease productivity in the short term.

- Those working in close proximity to each other, pre-pandemic, received more feedback on their code. Sitting near teammates meant more senior colleagues gave more feedback to their juniors, the researchers explain.
- Once everyone went remote in 2020, the mentorship gap between workers in the two arrangements disappeared.
Meanwhile: Engineers who worked in closer proximity before the pandemic wrote fewer software programs than those who were more dispersed. The decline in productivity was most pronounced for the senior coders — who were presumably busier mentoring colleagues.

- Once all the employees moved to remote work, junior workers who'd been on the close-together team were more likely to get a raise, perhaps benefiting from that early-on mentorship.
- During the pandemic period, the close-together workers had higher quit rates. The better training allowed them to score better paying jobs, the researchers theorized.
The intrigue: Once proximity wasn't possible in an all-remote setting, the company began hiring workers with more training. Buying talent instead of building it.

- That move suggests that in the long run, businesses adapt to the way work is performed and could help explain why remote work didn't significantly change productivity rates in that first paper.
The big picture: At the highest level, the Labor Department measures productivity by looking at how much gets created divided by hours worked.

- But once you start zooming in from there, things get tricky. Especially in the realm of knowledge work, where WFH is most prevalent and typically workers are not producing easily measurable outputs (like widgets, say).

New Hampshire voters have the power to quickly turn the primaries into a general election campaign, depending on Tuesday night's margins.

The big picture: This is former UN ambassador Nikki Haley's best chance to prove she can run a competitive head-to-head race with former President Trump.

## DeSantis unloads on Trump right after endorsing him

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis may have endorsed former President Trump, but his rhetoric since dropping out of the GOP presidential race on Sunday suggests their bitter rivalry is far from over.

Why it matters: Most Republicans who have gone through phases of Trump skepticism or opposition — including candidates for president this cycle — ultimately end up "kissing the ring," as DeSantis himself described it.

## The odds of an immediate Fed rate cut are falling

If you listened to a lot of market commentary a month ago, you would have gotten the sense that an early 2024 interest rate cut was a sure thing. Now, it's looking more like a coin flip.

Why it matters: When the easing cycle begins — whether it turns out to be March or later — it will be a meaningful signal that a period of aggressive monetary tightening has ended and Fed officials are comfortable that inflation is at a low risk of flaring up again.
