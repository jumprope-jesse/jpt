No-Code Agent Builder demo

A code-first approach for building and managing multi-agent systems. Engineering teams can build with the tools and developer experience they expect.

The Visual Builder and TypeScript SDK are fully interoperable: your technical and non-technical teams can edit and manage Agents in either format and switch or collaborate with others at any time.

Inkeep Agents can operate as Agentic Chat Assistants, for example:

- a customer experience agent for help centers, technical docs, or in-app experiences
- an internal copilot to assist your support, sales, marketing, ops, and other teams
Agents can also be used for Agentic Workflow Automation like:

- Creating and updating knowledge bases, documentation, and blogs
- Updating CRMs, triaging helpdesk tickets, and tackling repetitive tasks
Inkeep Open Source includes:

- A Visual Builder & TypeScript SDK with 2-way sync
- Multi-agent architecture to support teams of agents
- MCP Tools with credentials management
- A UI component library for dynamic chat experiences
- Triggering Agents via MCP, A2A, & Vercel SDK APIs
- Observability via a Traces UI & OpenTelemetry
- Easy deployment to Vercel and using Docker

Inkeep is designed to be extensible and open: you can use the LLM provider of your choice, use Agents via open protocols, and with a fair-code license and great devex, easily deploy and self-host Agents in your own infra.
