### Why Happy?

Keep using your favorite tools, editors, and development environments exactly as before. Happy integrates with your existing setup without requiring any changes to how you work.

Speak commands and watch them execute instantly. Not just transcription - true voice-to-action that lets you code, debug, and manage projects while completely hands-free.
