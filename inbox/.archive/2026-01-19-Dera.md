# A Single Platform to

Manage your embeddings and chunks with ease.

Compare and analyse results to build production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

## Iterate on your chunking strategy rapidly

A good RAG system depends on good retrievals, and good retrievals depend on good chunking strategies that result in quality embeddings. With Dera, you can

1. Create different embedding schemas easily
1. Track matching results
1. View the results in the app
## Visualize and evaluate

Inspired by Jerry Liu's (CEO & Cofounder of LlamaIndex) talk, and frustrated by our own experience when building RAG applications, we build this tool to help visualize and evaluate text and embeddings data.

## Reduce costs while ensuring scalability

Dera is built on Neon Database, which allows us to reduce costs while ensuring scalability for our users.

## Completely open-source

Dera is completely open-source and you're free to self-host. Check out our Github for more information. Our cloud offering is always available if you prefer to save the hassle.
