## Content (from Notion)

Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning (ML)-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud. It enables you to create and publish interactive dashboards and highly formatted reports accessible through web browsers or mobile devices. On November 16, 2023 – QuickSight has launched a new analysis experience, enabling a more intuitive and efficient way for you to author dashboards on QuickSight. In this post, we will walk you through the key experiences of this redesign and explore the enhanced workflows that empowers authors to create beautiful dashboards and reports.

With the new experience, we have redesigned the core authoring workflows to be more intuitive, scalable, and efficient. This post outlines the key elements and the core authoring workflows that has been redesigned.

## Key experiences

QuickSight offers the following key experiences with this redesign:

- 3-pane layout – Offers a new, streamlined layout that provides a clear and organized workspace for easy navigation between data, visualization building, and object properties. The 3-pane analysis experience includes updates to pane components, new vertically organized field wells, drag and drop fields, add/edit workflow, visual type selector redesign, and the Properties pane.
- The Analysis toolbar 
The following shows how the core authoring workflows are redesigned to streamline the creation process:

- Add visual – Authors will experience a smoother process of seamlessly adding visuals to their canvas in multiple ways. We’ve made it easier to differentiate between adding visuals and adding other objects like text and custom content, which provides authors with greater flexibility and control.
- Change visuals – Changing visual is now more intentional with the redesigned UI. Based on whether the author has a visual selected or not, the UI adapts to the context, preventing any accidental changes while still enabling seamless modification.
- Adding data to visuals 
- Edit properties 
Navigating the the new experience: While most changes we have introduced are designed to be intuitive, we are also introducing the ability for authors to search any analysis action to resolve the challenges of discovering features and workflows. Integrated within the Analysis menu, quick search significantly eases the task of locating any feature within the analysis experience. With search results refined with each keystroke, quick search makes finding specific features effortless. You can navigate to desired features, while boosting productivity in dashboard creation tasks.

Opting out of the beta experience – If you want to return to the previous experience, you can do so until January 31, 2024. To opt out, click New Look in the top right of the toolbar, then select Switch back. You can always revisit this option to switch back to the new look when you’re ready.

## Console Embedding Experience

Starting December 20, 2023 – the new experience will also be available for authors and customers using the analysis experience in an embedded mode.

## Conclusion

In this post, we showed how the redesigned analysis experience further enables QuickSight to serve as a robust, flexible, and secure BI platform suitable for a wide range of data analytics requirements. The new analysis experience is already available in Amazon QuickSight Standard and Enterprise Editions. For console embedding customers the new experience will be available starting December 20, 2023.
