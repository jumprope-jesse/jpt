# A study found that X’s algorithm now loves two things: Republicans and Elon Musk

## Overview (from Notion)
- The algorithm changes on X could influence the political landscape and social discussions, potentially affecting your community and family conversations.
- As a software engineer and founder, you might find the ethical implications of algorithmic bias intriguing, especially concerning how tech shapes public opinion.
- The study highlights a pattern of favoring conservative content, suggesting a need for critical evaluation of platforms you use for business and personal engagement.
- Consider how algorithm changes might impact user trust in social media, which could affect your business strategies and marketing approaches.
- Alternative views could focus on the idea that algorithm adjustments are common across platforms, serving different interests, and might not be strictly partisan.
- Engaging with differing viewpoints and discussions around these changes could provide insights into how to navigate tech's influence on society and your role in it.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
A study from Queensland University of Technology found that Elon Musk's posts on X received significantly more engagement after he endorsed Donald Trump's presidential campaign, with views increasing by 138% and retweets by 238%. The research suggests that X's algorithm may have been adjusted to favor Musk and other conservative accounts, reflecting potential right-wing bias. However, the researchers noted limitations due to restricted access to data from X's Academic API.

Elon Musk’s X may have tweaked its algorithm to boost his account, along with those of other conservative-leaning users, starting around the time he announced his support of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. That’s according to a new study published by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), which found that Musk’s posts in particular were suddenly much more popular.

The study’s authors — QUT associate professor in digital media Timothy Graham and Monash University communications and media studies professor Mark Andrejevic — first looked at Musk’s engagement before and after his July endorsement of Trump. They report that starting around July 13th, Musks’ posts received 138 percent more views and 238 percent more retweets than before that date.

The yellow line shows Musk’s view counts jumping significantly after that date. The green line jumps, too, but far, far less so.

Musk’s numbers “outpaced the general engagement trends observed across the platform,” they concluded. (This paper isn’t the first time it’s been suggested that X adjusted its algorithm to specifically boost Musk’s account.) The researchers also found that other Republican-leaning accounts they examined saw similar boosts that started in July, albeit to a lesser degree.

The study’s results are similar to other recently reported findings by The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post of potential right-wing bias in X’s algorithms. However, the researchers say they were limited by the “relatively small amount of data” that could be collected since the platform cut off access to its Academic API. They add that although they don’t see indications of missing data, there’s “no guarantee that 100% of posts have been collected.”
