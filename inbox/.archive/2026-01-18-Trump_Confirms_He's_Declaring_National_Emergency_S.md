Donald Trump‘s determination to conduct mass deportations of undocumented immigrants is very real, and he wants to start cracking down immediately. One of the ways he plans to do so is by declaring a national emergency that will enable him to use the military to help boot migrants out of the United States.

The president-elect on Monday responded “TRUE!!!” to a Truth Social post about reports that his incoming administration is “prepared to declare a national emergency and will use military assets to reverse the Biden invasion through a mass deportation program.”

The confirmation came at 4:08 a.m.

Trump built his 2024 presidential campaign around a vow to lock down the border and forcibly — and violently — deport the undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States. He spoke repeatedly about an “invasion” of migrants who are “poisoning the blood” of the nation, and even claiming that undocumented immigrants have been “conquering” American cities.

He’s been insistent since winning the election that immigration is his top priority, telling NBC News that his administration will spare no expense when it comes to deportation. “It’s not a question of a price tag,” he said. “It’s not — really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they’re going to go back to those countries because they’re not staying here. There is no price tag.”

There will certainly be a price tag, however, and it will be high given the logistical implications of removing millions of people from the nation. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is not currently equipped to carry out Trump’s deportation agenda, which calls for quadrupling the number of deportations the agency carries out every year.

Politico reported Monday on some of the tactics the administration plans to start cracking down, noting that deportations will commence within Trump’s first 100 days in office, and that his team is looking for ways to expedite the process that will withstand any legal challenges from rights groups. Trump is also expected to quickly do away with a Biden administration policy that prioritized deporting migrants who threatened public safety and national security, and directed ICE officers to take “the totality of the facts and circumstances” into consideration before deporting migrants with criminal convictions.

Tom Homan, the immigration hardliner Trump recently tapped as his “border czar,” has said criminals will be the first to go, while teasing the administration’s aggressive approach to deportation. “I got three words for them: shock and awe,” Homan told Donald Trump Jr. of the administration’s approach. “Shock and awe. You’re going to see us take this country back.”
