# The 2024 Stratechery Year in Review – Stratechery by Ben Thompson

## Content (from Notion)

Stratechery, incredibly enough, has been my full-time job for over a decade; this is the 12th year-in-review. Here are the previous editions:

2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 2013

It has long been a useful cliché to say that covering tech is easy, because something is always happening; now that that something is AI, that is more true than ever. Nearly every Article on Stratechery this year was about AI in some way or another, and that is likely to be true for years to come.

This year Stratechery published 29 free Articles, 109 subscriber Updates, and 40 Interviews. Today, as per tradition, I summarize the most popular and most important posts of the year.

### The Five Most-Viewed Articles

The five most-viewed articles on Stratechery according to page views:

1. Intel Honesty — The best way to both save Intel and have leading edge manufacturing in the U.S. is to split the company, and for the U.S. government to pick up the bill via purchase guarantees.
1. Gemini and Google’s Culture — The Google Gemini fiasco shows that the biggest challenge for Google in AI is not business model but rather company culture; change is needed from the top down.
1. Intel’s Humbling — Intel under Pat Gelsinger is reaping the disaster that came from a lack of investment and execution a decade ago; the company, though, appears to be headed in the right direction, as evidenced by its execution and recent deal with UMC.
1. The Apple Vision Pro — The Apple Vision Pro is a disappointment for productivity, in part because of choices made to deliver a remarkable entertainment experience. Plus, the future of AR/VR for Apple and Meta.
1. MKBHDs For Everything — Marques Brownlee has tremendous power because he can go direct to consumers; that is possible in media, and AI will make it possible everywhere.

### AI and the Future

Looking ahead to how AI will change everything.

- Enterprise Philosophy and The First Wave of AI — The first wave of successful AI implementations will probably look more like the first wave of computing, which was dominated by large-scale enterprise installations that eliminated jobs. Consumer will come later. YouTube
- The Gen AI Bridge to the Future — Generative AI is the bridge to the next computing paradigm of wearables, just like the Internet bridged the gap from PCs to smartphones.
- The New York Times’ AI Opportunity — The New York Times is suing OpenAI, but it is the New York Times that stands to benefit the most from large language models, thanks to its transformation to being an Internet entity. YouTube
- AI Integration and Modularization — Breaking down the Big Tech AI landscape through the lens of integration and modularization. YouTube
- Aggregator’s AI Risk — A single AI can never make everyone happy, which is fundamentally threatening to the Aggregator business model; the solution is personalized AI. YouTube

### Government and Regulation

An emerging theme this year — which I expect to continue alongside AI — is the rising importance of non-economic factors in terms of technological development, even as regulators ramp up pressure on the giants of the Aggregator era.

- A Chance to Build — Silicon Valley has always been deeply integrated with Asia; Trump’s attempt to change trade could hurt Silicon Valley more than expected, and also present opportunities to build something new. YouTube
- Intel’s Death and Potential Revival — Intel died when mobile cost it its software differentiation; if the U.S. wants a domestic foundry, then it ought to leverage the need for AI chips to make an independent Intel foundry viable. YouTube
- The E.U. Goes Too Far — Recent E.U. regulatory decisions cross the line from market correction to property theft; if the E.U. continues down this path they are likely to see fewer new features and no new companies. YouTube
- Friendly Google and Enemy Remedies — The DOJ brought the right kind of case against an Aggregator, which stagnates by being too nice; the goal is for companies to act like they actually have enemies. YouTube
- United States v. Apple — Apple is being sued by the DOJ, but most of the complaints aren’t about the App Store. I think, though, Apple’s approach to the App Store is what led to this case.

### Big Tech

The biggest tech companies, as usual, provided the most consistent lens on how the world is changing.

- Meta’s AI Abundance — Meta is well-positioned to the biggest beneficiary of AI and the largest company in the world. YouTube
- Gemini 1.5 and Google’s Nature — Google Cloud Next 2024 was Google’s most impressive assertion yet that it has the AI scale advantage and is determined to use it. YouTube (See also: Integration and Android)
- Elon Dreams and Bitter Lessons — SpaceX’s triumph is downstream of a dream and getting the cost structure necessary to make it happen; Elon Musk is trying the same approach for Tesla self-driving cars. YouTube
- Apple Intelligence is Right On Time — Apple is expected to announce a range of AI features at WWDC; the company is well placed to benefit from AI: they are not too late, but right on time. YouTube (See also: WWDC, Apple Intelligence, Apple Aggregates AI)
- Nvidia Waves and Moats — Nvidia’s GTC was an absolute spectacle; it was also a different kind of keynote than before ChatGPT, which is related to Nvidia’s need to dig a new kind of software moat. YouTube
