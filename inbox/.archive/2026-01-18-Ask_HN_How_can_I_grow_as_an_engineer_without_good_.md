# Ask HN: How can I grow as an engineer without good seniors to learn from? | Hacker News

## Content (from Notion)

so many red flags here

> fresh graduate data engineer

to the company, they see this as "cheap labor"

> hired 6 months ago as a freelance

basically, they put you through the ringer without having to pay out benefits

> essentially functioning as a tech lead

a fresh out of college graduate is far from being qualified as "tech lead", you are out of depth here

> with full responsibility and ownership of designing, implementing, and hiring for the projects I'm assigned

basically you are a 1-bus factor team. hope you have negotiated pay accordingly.

> Our company is not a tech company, so I only have a couple of tech-oriented colleagues

you are a second class citizen at this company, your budget will be constrained, and be on the first to cut when it gets tough. In the O&G industry, the boom and bust cycles are quite frequent.

> Now I directly report to the director of the company

now there's internal pressure to perform at a much higher level than your experience.

If you want real advice, get the hell out of this company while you can. O&G industry itself is notorious for back stabbing/conniving.
