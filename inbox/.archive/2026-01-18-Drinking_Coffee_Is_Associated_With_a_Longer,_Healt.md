# Drinking Coffee Is Associated With a Longer, Healthier Life, According to a New Study - The New York Times

## Overview (from Notion)
- Coffee consumption may boost healthy aging, which is particularly relevant as you balance work and family life.
- The study highlights a significant correlation between caffeine intake and longevity, suggesting that enjoying coffee could positively impact your long-term health.
- Living in NYC, where coffee culture is prevalent, provides ample opportunities to integrate this habit into your daily routine.
- Interesting viewpoint: Caffeine could enhance your productivity and mental sharpness as a software engineer and founder, giving you an edge in a competitive field.
- Alternate view: While coffee has benefits, moderation is key; relying too heavily on caffeine could lead to dependency or disrupt sleep, impacting overall health and family time.
- Consider exploring other health practices alongside coffee, such as exercise and a balanced diet, to create a holistic approach to longevity.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
A new study suggests that coffee consumption is linked to healthier aging, with over 47,000 female nurses followed for decades showing that those who drank more caffeine had a 13% higher likelihood of healthy aging. The study, though not yet peer-reviewed, adds to existing evidence of coffee's health benefits, including lower risks of chronic diseases.

Most people who drink coffee appreciate the quick jolt of energy it provides. But in a new study, presented today at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, scientists have found that coffee may offer the much longer-term benefit of healthy aging.

The study has not been peer-reviewed or published, but it was rigorous and included a large number of women who were followed for many years. It also adds to a large body of evidence linking coffee to longer lives and various health advantages, including lower risks of certain chronic diseases — though all of these studies had limitations, including that they were observational and could not prove cause and effect.

Still, the results linking coffee to healthier aging were not surprising, said Fang Fang Zhang, a professor of nutritional epidemiology at Tufts University who was not involved with the study. “The data is quite consistent that coffee consumption is actually beneficial,” she said.

## What did the new research find?

In the study, researchers followed more than 47,000 female nurses for several decades beginning in the 1970s. Every few years, the women answered detailed questions about their diets, including how much coffee, tea and cola (like Coca-Cola or Pepsi) they typically drank. Then, the scientists looked at how many of the women were still alive and met their definition of “healthy aging” in 2016.

Just over 3,700 women met that criteria: They were 70 or older; reported good physical and mental health, with no cognitive impairment or memory problems; and were free of 11 chronic diseases such as cancer, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.

The researchers found a correlation between how much caffeine the women typically drank (which was mostly from coffee) when they were between 45 and 60 years old and their likelihood of healthy aging. After adjusting for other factors that could affect aging, such as their overall diet, how much they exercised and whether they smoked, those who consumed the most caffeine (equivalent to nearly seven eight-ounce cups of coffee per day) had odds of healthy aging that were 13 percent higher than those who consumed the least caffeine (equivalent to less than one cup per day).
