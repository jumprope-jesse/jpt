- Use push notifications to monitor server performance or software deployments, allowing you to balance work and home life efficiently.
- Explore the open-source aspect; engage with a community that shares your interests, potentially leading to collaborations or new projects.

## Send push notifications from your app or script

Publishing messages can be done via PUT or POST. Topics are created on the fly by subscribing or publishing to them. If you use ntfy without sign-up, the topic is essentially a password, so pick something that's not easily guessable. If you purchase ntfy Pro, you can reserve topic names instead.

## Receive notifications on your phone

Subscribe to a topic and receive notifications, with different priorities, attachments, action buttons, tags & emojis, and even for automation.

Alert yourself about unauthorized logins, when your show was downloaded, or when your home automation sensors detect movement in the yard. ntfy hooks into anything and everything.

You can define a notification priority, which maps to different sounds & vibration patterns. Action buttons allows you to react to notifications directly, and tags and emojis let you classify & personalize notifications.

With ntfy attachments, you can send images, videos, and other files to your phone instantly - be it pictures from your surveillance camera, videos, or other documents

You can use the web app to subscribe to topics as well. If you do, notifications will pop up as desktop notifications. Simply type in the topic name and click the Subscribe button. The browser will keep a connection open and listen for incoming notifications.

Publishing messages is just a HTTP request, so pretty much everything under the sun can integrate with ntfy.

Whether it's receiving alerts from cronjobs, or when a GitHub Actions pipeline finishes, or when a new episode of your TV show is available, or when any website has a change ❤️, ntfy will let you know.

Wow, I just discovered this great open source project which allows to send push notifications to iOS/Androids/Desktop. The server component can be self hosted and the API seems to be very powerful and rich on features!Marc

This is an awesome self hosted notification app with a ton of features with tons more planned! You don't have to use it self hosted either - there is a public server available.Pat
