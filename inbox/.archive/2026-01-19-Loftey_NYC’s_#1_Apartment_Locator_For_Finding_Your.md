Why we ask for this info

Loftey has chosen to use the real estate board of New York’s (REBNY) listing database, the most reliable and comprehensive source of verified listings in NYC. While we may reach out to you via email/text to provide you with the best experience possible, the reason we ask for this information is because REBNY requires it in order to view their listings. Thank you for understanding and we look forward to helping you with your apartment search.
