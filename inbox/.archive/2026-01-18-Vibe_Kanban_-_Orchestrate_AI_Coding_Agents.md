# Vibe Kanban - Orchestrate AI Coding Agents

## Overview (from Notion)
- Vibe Kanban's parallel coding agents could free up your time for family and personal projects, reducing the mental load associated with coding tasks.
- The reliance on coding agents suggests a shift in the engineering landscape, allowing you to focus on higher-level planning and quality rather than routine debugging.
- The rapid improvement of coding agents means you'll be able to leverage more efficient tools in the near future, enhancing productivity.
- The idea that foundational model labs will compete to create better coding agents opens the door to innovation, potentially leading to tools that could transform your workflow.
- Consider the potential downsides: increased reliance on AI could lead to skill degradation in areas like manual coding and debugging.
- An alternate view might argue that while coding agents are useful, they could also introduce new complexities in managing AI outputs and ensuring code quality.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Vibe Kanban enables parallel operation of coding agents with conflict-free execution and efficient code reviews. The reliability of coding agents has reached a level where they are preferred for most tasks, and their rapid improvement is expected to continue. As foundational models evolve, engineers will need tools that adapt to these advancements without altering their workflows.

Vibe Kanban lets you run coding agents in parallel without conflicts, and perform code review through our diff tool. Now you can focus on planning and quality instead of watching terminal logs.

## Motivation

Coding agents are reliable enough to be the default: We've built and tested coding agents for years and realised recently that reliability crossed an invisible threshold that means we now prefer starting most tasks with coding agents.

Coding agents are going to get much better: Coding agents have improved rapidly, and we expect this trend to continue. Imagine that in six months, 50% of the current failure modes of coding agents will get fixed, and six months after that another 50%. What will we (engineers) be spending our time on in that world? What tools would help us do that work most efficiently?

The SOTA will change: Foundational model labs and application layer startups will continuously leap-frog each other to build state-of-the-art coding agents over the next 12m+. You shouldn't have to change your workflow or behaviour to be able to try out different coding agents.
