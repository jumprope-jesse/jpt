# Vibe Kanban - Orchestrate AI Coding Agents

## Overview (from Notion)
- Vibe Kanban offers a streamlined way to manage multiple coding agents, which could save you significant time and effort in your software projects.
- The ability to orchestrate coding agents in parallel means you can tackle more complex tasks without getting bogged down, allowing for more efficient work-life balance as a founder.
- The emphasis on reliability and improvement in coding agents suggests that your role may shift from hands-on coding to more strategic oversight, potentially freeing up time for family and personal pursuits.
- Consider how the rapid advancement of coding agent technology might influence your hiring decisions, focusing on engineers who can adapt to these new tools.
- Alternative views might argue that reliance on coding agents could lead to a loss of in-depth coding skills among engineers, which might affect problem-solving capabilities in the long run.
- The evolving landscape of coding agents could inspire you to rethink your company's approach to software development, possibly integrating more AI-driven solutions to stay competitive.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Vibe Kanban facilitates the use of coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Amp by allowing users to switch between agents, orchestrate their execution, review work, track task statuses, and centralize configurations. It emphasizes the reliability of coding agents and anticipates significant improvements in their performance, suggesting that engineers will need to adapt their workflows as these tools evolve.

An overview of vibe-kanban

Vibe Kanban helps you get the most out of coding agents like Claude Code, Gemini CLI and Amp. Vibe Kanban helps you:

1. Easily switch between different coding agents
1. Orchestrate the execution of multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
1. Quickly review work and start dev servers
1. Track the status of tasks that your coding agents are working on
1. Centralise configuration of coding agent MCP configs
Make sure you have a coding agent installed, and have completed any login/auth steps required by the coding agent you want to use. Then in your terminal run:

```plain text
npx vibe-kanban

```

Vibe Kanban will find an available port on your machine and open the app in your browser.

Coding agents are reliable enough to be the default: We've built and tested coding agents for years and realised recently that reliability crossed an invisible threshold that means we now prefer starting most tasks with coding agents.

Coding agents are going to get much better: Coding agents have improved rapidly, and we expect this trend to continue. Imagine that in six months, 50% of the current failure modes of coding agents will get fixed, and six months after that another 50%. What will we (engineers) be spending our time on in that world? What tools would help us do that work most efficiently?

The SOTA will change: Foundational model labs and application layer startups will continuously leap-frog each other to build state-of-the-art coding agents over the next 12m+. You shouldn't have to change your workflow or behaviour to be able to try out different coding agents.
