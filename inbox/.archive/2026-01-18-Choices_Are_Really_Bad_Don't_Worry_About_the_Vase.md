# Choices Are Really Bad | Don't Worry About the Vase

## Overview (from Notion)
- Choices and Parenting: Consider how the decisions you make impact your family's values and experiences. Too many choices can lead to decision fatigue, affecting your ability to enjoy family time.

- Work-Life Balance: The article discusses how choices can lead to paralysis; reflect on how this might manifest in your work as a software engineer and founder. Are you overwhelmed by options and unable to make firm commitments?

- Long-Term Impact: The notion that community values can shift over time is relevant. Your role as a founder could mean fostering a culture in your company that aligns with your values, preventing a drift away from your original mission.

- Cultural Influence: Living in New York City, the cultural pressures to achieve and succeed may clash with personal goals. How can you navigate these influences without losing sight of what you want for your family?

- Unique Perspective: The idea that too many choices lead to worse outcomes is counterintuitive but compelling. It might inspire you to simplify decision-making processes, both at home and in your company.

- Alternate Views: Some may argue that having more options leads to better outcomes. Engaging with this perspective could help refine your decision-making framework, balancing freedom and clarity.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Choices can lead to decision fatigue, willpower depletion, and the risk of making poor decisions. They create a sense of responsibility and blame, complicating social interactions and cooperation. The culture surrounding choices can detract from a community's mission, emphasizing personal comfort over collective goals. Maintaining high standards and a commitment to rationalist values is essential to ensure that the community remains focused on impactful actions rather than becoming complacent.

Previously: Choices are Bad

Last time, I gave two (related) reasons Choices are Bad: Choices Reduce Perceived Value and Choices Force You Into Choosing Mode. Despite not looking like much, these reasons are Serious Business. They can render us unable to enjoy, think or relax even when it might seem that everything is awesome. That’s what that song is about, really: how great things are, on every axis, when we let ourselves go with the flow and not get distracted.

The rabbit hole goes deeper. It gets much worse.

## Choices Cost Willpower and Create Decision Fatigue

Willpower is a controversial topic, and laying out even my simple model would be beyond scope. What matters here is that in the short term, exercising willpower is a cost (whether or not such use has long term benefits). Most of the time, you would prefer to spend less willpower to get the same result.

Often making the otherwise right choice will require the spending of willpower. When you consciously think about eating another cookie, or checking your email, not doing so costs a non-zero amount of willpower. Making that choice over and over could end up not only being distracting via being in choosing mode, but also end up sapping your willpower.

In addition to willpower, Decision Fatigue is a thing as well. Making choices (decisions) is draining something else that is related to but not identical to willpower. At some point, decision fatigue makes further choices carry an increasing cost. Some people have this problem more often than others, but there is always the risk that this will happen to you.

There’s even a version of ‘I’ve made good choices all day, it’s all right to indulge now’ that can happen, which is related but different.

## You Might Choose Wrong

Image result for you have chosen poorly

Simple but important.

If you give someone a choice, there is always some chance they will choose wrong. Remember the third principle of economics: People are stupid. They also are often ignorant, or distracted, or don’t care, or lots of other things. Mistakes are made. No matter how obvious the choice, people will sometimes choose… poorly.

Thus, giving me a choice between a Snickers bar that I value at $1 and M&Ms I value at 60 cents doesn’t only force me into choosing mode, lower my perceived value and help create decision fatigue (and potentially cost willpower). It also risks that if I’m not paying attention or thinking clearly, I will choose the M&Ms, and that would be a tragedy.

Pictured: Someone who has chosen poorly.

## You Will Choose Wrong

Often you have a decision in the future, and you have a reasonable expectation that when the time comes you will be likely to choose poorly. The reasons are myriad.

You might fear temptation or hyperbolic discouting. You know you shouldn’t have that snack now, or check Facebook, but you will later if given the chance, and you know it. Or you expect to reach a point where your journey gets harder before it gets easier, such as in an exercise program, and you are tempted to quit.

You might expect to be in a social situation where you face pressure to do the wrong thing, such as talking to a salesman, or drinking too much at a party.

You might expect to drink too much at a party, or otherwise be in an impaired state, and be unable to make good choices.

You might simply expect to forget what you currently know, or what you are thinking, or to overthink things, or not care.

You might have a choice where you would prefer result A to result B, but given a choice of A and B, you will still feel you must choose B. More on that later.

In all these situations and more, the choice is doing more than taxing your focus. The choice is going to get you.

## Choices Create Buy-In

When forced to make a choice, humans then identify with that choice and need to justify it. Sometimes this is good, and can even be an explicit reason to make (or set up!) a given choice. Most of the time it causes identity to become larger in a bad way.

You suddenly think whatever you chose was a good idea, and are forced to adjust other beliefs to agree with that. This is especially dangerous when the choice is set up make you feel like you had a voice in the decision. Whichever option you chose, even if it was between two terrible restaurants, two cars that only differ by color, or voting for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, starts to seem like it was a good idea. You avoid taking actions or making statements that would contradict your choice. If you had only not had a choice in the matter, you would be free to believe, speak and act correctly later.

## Choices Create Blame and Responsibility

Being blamed for things is obviously terrible, and being seen as responsible means you have to do things you could have chosen to do anyway, and if something goes wrong, as Kramer noted on Seinfeld, the first question anyone asks is “Who’s Responsible?” In addition, it means others will slack off, treating the situation as Someone Else’s Problem – you are responsible! I could explain at length, but we all instinctively know Responsibility Is Bad and Blame Is Bad. At a minimum, being held responsible involuntarily is bad, and being blamed involuntarily is very bad!

If you choose between a Snicker’s Bar and a pack of M&Ms, it is your fault there is no Snickers bar or it is your fault there are no M&Ms. If all you were offered was a Snicker’s bar, you’re the nice one who acquired candy.

Choices force to you to interact with the problem. Interacting with the problem then subjects you to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics (link is recommended if you haven’t read it). You are interacting with the problem, and therefore everything wrong with it is your fault, or at least everything you could possibly have done something about, even if that action would have been absurd. Even if all you did was help.

If you were so lucky as not to have a choice to do anything more to help, then you would be able to interact with the problem without being blamed for it, which would be much better.

You really don’t want the option to buy a better version you can’t afford. You might end up buying nothing.

You really don’t want the option to give away every last dollar you can spare to charity. You might end up giving nothing.

## Choices Cause Paralysis

Without any choice you can justify – you could always do more, in some sense, or always potentially find something better – analysis paralysis sets in. If no choice it satisfactory, the default choice is often to do nothing at all, or sit around thinking and agonizing over things for far too long. This happens even if you know that taking a random reasonable option would be far better.

If you had no choice, or you had less choice such that what you actually want to do clearly dominated your other options, you would be able to take action.

## Choices Are Communication

Just Saying What You Mean is Impossible. Every action you take speaks volumes.

If you don’t want to come to the party, you’d much rather not be invited than have to say no. Oh dear, it’s raining really hard. A shame we can’t make it.

You would much rather the cancer be inoperable than be given the chance to spend all your family’s money on a treatment that almost certainly won’t work and will definitely be painful, for fear of being seen as not caring or giving up.

You would like to sometimes not have access to your phone, so others couldn’t interrupt you all hours of the day with emails and texts.

## Choices Require Justificaiton

I recently wrote a post that explored, among other things, the problem of when you know the right choice, but you don’t know how to justify that choice or explain your reasoning. There are a lot of reasons why this can be a problem.

Often we have reasons we can’t fully put into words, whether or not we should have to, and sometimes we don’t know the reason but we do know we have a bad feeling about this:

And yet, that phrase usually leads to the doing of the this in question.

Sometimes our reasons reveal information we need to keep secret, or reveal we know information we are not supposed to know, or which will be unpleasant to bring up. Sometimes everyone already knows, and we know everyone already knows, but we must prevent common knowledge.

Sometimes our reasons rely on information we cannot say out loud. Our society currently says that people who say or believe certain things, even once for a moment, are just awful and anyone who notices such a belief or behavior should notify the internet mobs post haste. Many of these things happen to be both true and central to life, which makes explicit reasoning and justification difficult.

## Choices Prevent Commitment, Cooperation and Coordination

We’ve already noted how the choice to quit can destroy an exercise program or other plan; instead of deciding once it is a good idea, you must decide over and over again that it is a good idea. If you fail even once, that’s it. All your future selves get a vote, and if you get a tally of 79-1, you still lose. That’s terrible.

What’s worse is if there are two of you, and you’re trying to cooperate on a plan, knowing that a vote of 159-1 also loses. Can you count on the other person showing up, and toughing it out, or will they bail when given the chance? Should you therefore tough it out knowing they might quit? Will they, knowing you might quit on them first?

Now both of you have to constantly track the others’ choices, to make sure incentives align at every step, lest everything fall apart. Both of you need to keep fallback options, not only in case you need them, but to show you have them lest the other party use your lack of a fallback as leverage against you.

This process is more painful than people realize; in many situations it destroys most of the potential production/surplus/utility. Many, many otherwise good ideas, arguably most otherwise good ideas, will not work because trying to do the thing gives others leverage over you that they can’t give up, so they will reliably take all of your profits. In many cases, due to your sunk costs, they will take far more than all your profits.

## Choosing To Stop

This post is an example. I could go on for a long time; this is far from an exhaustive list, but I need to stop somewhere or I’ll never get it published. Or it will get so long that no one will read it or know which points were important. Or both.

## I Had No Choice!

Think about why “I Had No Choice!” is so often used. Technically we almost always have lots of choices, but most of those choices would be disastrous. You could give all you have to the poor. You could run naked through the city streets shouting about aliens. You could refuse to get out of bed for weeks on end. You could give the customer a full refund without a receipt. You could shoot that jerk right in the face.

And so on. Most of the time, these are not considered real choices because the consequences are so obviously bad, so we say I have no choice. This saves us from worrying about missing out on the option, and it protects us against blame. You aren’t signaling anything. You aren’t reducing anyone’s status. You aren’t letting anyone down. You’re doing the only thing you can. Which is good. Taking away choices is vital.

Others will respond with that awful accusation, “You Have/Had a Choice!” Their tone will often be quite unfriendly. You defend yourself. This isn’t on you. You insist: “I Do Not Have That Option, Sir or Madam!”

Because choices are really bad!

Rationalist Status: Wonky (if you are not interested in the rationalist community or mission, this one is not for you)

Epistemic Status: Continuing the discussion

Response to (read this first): The Craft Is Not The Community (Otium)

Sarah’s post, The Craft Is Not The Community, was explicitly intended to start a discussion. Her central thesis is that the community has proven itself bad at doing outward-facing projects, so members should do their community-focused projects together, and form a community that can fulfill its members emotional needs, but do their outward-facing and world-saving projects in the outside world and play by the outside world’s rules.

I want to focus elsewhere, at least for this post, and accuse Sarah of burying the lead. She does not actually bury it – it’s right up at the top of the post – but she views it as background rather than the thing to be focused on.

We need to focus on it.

Her leading paragraph is super important, and I strongly, violently agree with it:

> 

Those within a culture quickly learn what that culture truly values, and adopt their behaviors to that culture. Culture is super important. If we are building a physical community, and it seems that we are, we should think carefully about what culture we want that community to have, and work to ensure that we get what we want. Keeping what makes us unique requires constant vigilance in the best of times. We are building the community in 2017, and doing so in Berkeley, California. The pressures are and will be unending. Constant vigilance doesn’t begin to cover it.

Paul Graham once wrote a (recommended) piece called Cities and Ambition. Cities, he observes, have a culture. The great ones push you to work harder, achieve great things. They have a message about what you should be and what is good in life. The city constantly whispers that message in your ear.

He claims that New York, where I live, has the message that you should be richer. Fair enough. He says Boston wants you to be smarter. Again, fair enough. He thinks Silicon Valley’s message is to have impact on the world, and loves it; I see the real message as more like ‘you should excite people (with your ability to excite people about your ability to excite people)’ or ‘you should spend every hour of your life to follow our script for how to do a great start-up’ or something like that, and can’t watch the obvious excellent show Silicon Valley because it causes emotional flashbacks. I can see both arguments. Things were likely more as he describes back in the day. We have different perspectives.

What does he say is the message of Berkeley, in a piece from back in May 2008?

> I’d always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place—that it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better. Life in Berkeley is very civilized. It’s probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home. But it’s not humming with ambition.

Not heeding this warning, or perhaps because of it, the Rationalists have concentrated in Berkeley, California.

Sarah then reports, back in the present day:

> 

Sarah reports that a bunch of people settled in Berkeley, decided they should live better, and have done a bunch of things to help themselves live better but failed at attempts to do more ambitious outward facing things.

In the comments, blacktrance responds:

> There are different kinds of community-building, and some of them have more aspects of external projects. At one end of the spectrum, people who happen to live in the same town or neighborhood form a natural community that serves their needs and desires. At the other end, there are clubs formed around specific activities. The “local community”-type doesn’t have many standards beyond living in the area, but the club has them even if they’re not explicit (“If you don’t like reading, don’t join our book club”), and they may even be standards for excellence (“Our chess club is for people with an Elo above X”). A community between the two has to reconcile fulfilling the needs of its existing members with continuing to maintain the goal of being whatever kind of community it is.

Sarah then responds, in a sentence that should totally freak you out:

> I think that may have been true in 2012 or so, but I don’t think it’s true now.

No one could have predicted this. No one had any idea, as it was happening, that the choice of Berkeley might have been a mistake and not only because of the stratospheric rents.

Many of our best and brightest leave, hollowing out and devastating their local communities, to move to Berkeley, to join what they think of as The Rationalist Community. They feel comfortable ripping apart those other communities because they think the point of those communities was to feed their best people to the ‘real’ community in Berkeley; when not being careful they use the term ‘rationalist community’ interchangeably with ‘rationalists living in Berkeley’. Once there, they have an increasingly good time and develop new ways to have an increasingly good time, forming a real community. But that ‘rationalist community’ is ‘increasingly ill-named.’ Its central cultural theme is not rationality, or becoming stronger, or saving the world; it is, Sarah reports, an unconditional tolerance for weirdos, a paradise for Bohemians, a place built on warm connections of mutual support for those who don’t fit into broader society.

The rationalists took on Berkeley, and Berkeley won.

Berkeley doesn’t work for us. We work for Berkeley.

Huge, if true.

…And That’s Terrible?

Yes.

This is bad.

This is really bad.

This is unbelievably, world-doomingly bad. It means we’ve lost the mission.

This is taking many of the people most capable of saving the world, and putting them in a culture focused instead on better living. A culture that, rather than enforcing the mission, is encouraging them to lose the mission. A culture that is such a failure in its outward-facing goals that one of its best and brightest is now suggesting that anyone who wants to impact the outside world should do so without the community’s help.

Raemon777 (Raymond Arnold) puts it this way in the comments:

> As Quixote said, the reason I’m excited about *this* community is that it feels like it can in fact play a role in having a strong impact in the world. I’m driving across the country to be there right now because despite all the drama I hear about, the fact remains that whenever I visit the Bay there’s a palpable buzz in the air that “of *course* saving the world is the sort of thing you might do, or which you might try to optimize your socially-rewarding-stuff such that it ends up benefiting the world to some degree. This Buzz was what changed my life, and I think having it matters a lot.

This is super important. It is arguable whether we truly need a social life and a warm loving community in order to save the world, but most of us are not going to give up such things to go off on a mission. Unhappiness and burning out are not the way, and the fact that a community of like-minded people is being constructed that will give us sane ways to save on housing costs and educate our children, while putting lots of great minds where they can collaborate with each other, is an amazing and wonderful thing.

If we keep the mission.

If we keep the buzz that says, of *course* saving the world is not only the sort of thing you might do, it is the best thing to do. Another comment mentioned a great old post about Mythic Values versus Folk Values. We don’t need everyone to have the Mythic Rationalist Values, but we do need everyone to at least have the Folk Rationalist Values. We do need to require a basic affinity for The Sequences, and at least a good and expanding chunk of our toolbox of thinking skills, where an active quest to acquire said affinity and toolbox fully counts in your first year or two.

A community needs to have standards. A rationalist community needs to have rationalist standards. Otherwise we are something else, and our well-kept gardens die by pacifism and hopefully great parties.

Not everyone in our community can or should be out saving the world, but they should aspire to that, to helping with the mission, even as they focus on themselves and their own lives. That should be the thing of highest honor. We need to keep The Buzz. We need to remember what we are about. We need the mission.

That does not mean we should not be welcoming of weirdos; weirdos are awesome. Warm connections and mutual support are underrated and undersupplied everywhere. We absolutely should continue to welcome outcasts, sexual minorities and runaways, if they are otherwise part of our culture.

The problem is that if you are not careful, your culture becomes about welcoming such people. Ideally, the culture isn’t about welcoming such people, you just do it. It’s simple. You don’t have to organize your life around being a kind and decent human being you can just be a decent human being. Then get on with everything else.

Otherwise, you lose the mission, and all is lost.

The point of bringing all these amazing people together is so those people can make each other stronger. It’s so those people can work together, think together. It’s so those people can form a culture that makes them their best selves.

It’s so that the projects we start can use the rationalist culture we have created, as their company cultures. It’s so that when the outside world wants to capture our mission, and tells us that if we just stopped worrying so much about being technically accurate, we could do so much more, and start us down the standard incentive gradients that are a lot of why (to a first approximation) no one is able to accomplish anything, we can stand up and say no.

That does not mean that every project that is outward facing, or that tries to impact the world, needs to be purely internal. We are not legion, nor are we the only ones who can do anything. The skills and talents and connections and funds often lie elsewhere. There are even places that play by rules similar to our own; I happen to currently work at one of them.

In Conclusion

There is a ton more to unpack, and a lot more important claims that I disagree with, and a lot more detail to explore, but I want to get at least this out there now. I hope to lay out more posts that go into other details.

I want to reiterate that community and happiness are good things. I applaud the construction of a real community, even as I wince at the chosen location and the implementation details. I am glad people have found happiness.

Our short-term and even medium-term happiness is not enough. We have our values. We have our culture. We have a mission.

If Sarah is to believed (others who live in the area can speak to whether her observations are correct better than I can) then the community’s basic rationalist standards have degraded, and its priorities and cultural heart are starting to lie elsewhere. The community being built is rapidly ceasing to be all that rationalist, and is no longer conducive (and may be subtly but actively hostile) to the missions of saving and improving the world.

Its members might save or improve the world anyway, and I would still have high hopes for that including for MIRI and CFAR, but that would be in spite of the (local physical) community rather than because of it, if the community is discouraging them from doing so and they need to do all their work elsewhere with other people. Those who keep the mission would then depart, leaving those that remain all the more adrift.

I hope she is wrong, but I fear she is right. If she is right, sounding the alarm now has been a hugely valuable service, giving us a chance to save what is valuable.

If this is indeed what is happening, and I see reasonably strong evidence that it is, then we need to course correct before it is not too late. That starts with a commitment to honor our rationalist values and virtues, and to holding each other to high standards.

If it is already too late, the mission, and those who have kept it, need to go on elsewhere.
