## The Big Changes

This release has been over two years in the making, so we're really glad to finally get it out to you. The long cycle does mean quite an extensive changelog however, with well over 1100 pull requests merged into our master branch since 10.8.0 first dropped back in 2022. This section will detail all the big changes, broken up by general function and area of the system. In addition to these big items, there are hundreds of smaller bugfixes, quality-of-life tweaks, and other minor changes that we won't touch on here, but if you want to see the full list, you can do so over on the GitHub releases for the core server and the Web UI.

We're looking for contributors for our cast receiver. This is the application that loads on a TV when using the "Google Cast" feature. Please reach out if you're interested.

## The Next Version

With our continuous integrations improvements outlined previously, we're quite confident that this will be our last "very long" release cycle. Our plan is for the next major version (10.10.0) to be released at most 6 months from now, some time in October. We hope this increased cadence will help alleviate the problems with large releases such as a very long time-to-stable for new features, translations, etc. and help lower the number of major bugs at each major release, streamlining the upgrade process. But this needs everyone's help. Back in October 2023, we made a call for developers, and we've gotten a lot of interest, but this is not a one-and-done event. We need contributions now more than ever, especially around the web frontend to help implement our planned design changes. If this interests you, please reach out and we can help get you set up.

## Final Thoughts

We want to thank everyone who contributed to the 10.9.0 release. According to GitHub over 100 people contributed across both repositories, and Jellyfin wouldn't be what it is without your help. We're really proud of this project we've built as a community, and hope to continue to be the go-to FLOSS media system solution for a long time to come. Happy watching!
