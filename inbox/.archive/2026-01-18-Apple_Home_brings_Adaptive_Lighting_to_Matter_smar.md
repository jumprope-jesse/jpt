# Apple Home brings Adaptive Lighting to Matter smart lights in iOS 18 - The Verge

## AI Summary (from Notion)
- Adaptive Lighting Feature: Apple Home will support Adaptive Lighting for Matter-compatible smart lights starting with iOS 18, allowing automatic adjustment of light color temperature throughout the day.
- Initial Products: Nanoleaf's Essentials Matter line (A19 bulb and light strip) will be among the first to utilize this feature.
- CEO Confirmation: Nanoleaf's CEO, Gimmy Chu, confirmed extensive testing is underway to ensure a seamless user experience with Adaptive Lighting.
- Compatibility and Expansion: The integration of Adaptive Lighting with Matter devices means compatibility with a wider range of smart lights beyond just a few brands.
- User Experience: Adaptive Lighting has been popular among HomeKit users since its introduction, enhancing the ambiance of homes by adjusting lighting from cool to warm.
- Historical Context: The feature has existed since iOS 14, but adoption by manufacturers has been slow, with only a few like Nanoleaf and Philips Hue initially supporting it.
- Matter Standard: Matter is a new smart home interoperability standard designed to facilitate communication between devices without relying on cloud connections, enhancing security and privacy.
- Future of Adaptive Lighting: While Adaptive Lighting is exclusive to Apple Home, there is potential for similar features to be developed for other platforms in the future.
- Broader Implications: This advancement is significant for users of other smart lighting brands (e.g., Govee, Lifx) as they may also benefit from Adaptive Lighting through Apple Home.

Nanoleaf’s Essentials Matter line, which includes an A19 bulb and light strip, will be one of the first Matter products to work with Apple Home’s Adaptive Lighting feature.

A major feature of Apple Home will soon work with Matter devices. With iOS 18, Apple is enabling Adaptive Lighting for smart lights connected to its smart home platform through Matter, the interoperability standard developed by Apple, Amazon, and Google. The feature, which automatically adjusts the color temperature of smart lights throughout the day, currently only works with a few brands. Adding support for Matter bulbs means it should work with many more.

Gimmy Chu, CEO of Nanoleaf, confirmed to The Verge that his company is currently testing the feature on its line of Essentials Matter lights. “We are one of the partners that are part of the launch of Adaptive Lighting on Matter products,” he said in an interview. “For the past several months we’ve been doing extensive testing to ensure that the customers will have a great experience.”

This testing has led to Adaptive Lighting for Nanoleaf’s Matter products appearing in the iOS 18 betas, which is how The Verge first saw it. Users on Reddit in the betas reported seeing the toggle to enable Adaptive Lighting on their Nanoleaf smart bulbs.

Adaptive Lighting is popular among HomeKit users. Its ability to automatically adjust your lighting color temperature throughout the day, turning lights from cool to warm to make your home feel bright and refreshing or welcoming and cozy, is an easy quality-of-life upgrade for your lights. It’s been part of Apple Home since iOS 14, but uptake among manufacturers has been slow — Nanoleaf and Philips Hue were among the first, and Eve and Aqara also have compatible products. But that’s about it.

However, when Hue and Nanoleaf released Matter versions of their products (Hue by an upgrade to its bridge), Adaptive Lighting wasn’t available. Understandably, people were frustrated that the Matter products had less functionality than the existing products.

Chu explained that as much as Nanoleaf wanted to have Adaptive Lighting on its new Matter products, it wasn’t possible because Apple hadn’t enabled support for the feature in smart lights connected to its platform through Matter rather than HomeKit. (Hue users could keep Adaptive Lighting by not upgrading their bridge to Matter.)

But now, when iOS 18 arrives this fall, all of Nanoleaf’s Matter lights will work with Adaptive Lighting in Apple Home. The Verge reached out to Philips Hue to ask if it’s planning to enable the feature on its Matter bridge; as of publication, we have not heard back.

### What is Matter?

Matter is a new smart home interoperability standard designed to provide a common language for connected devices to communicate locally in your home without relying on a cloud connection. It is built to be secure and private, easy to set up, and widely compatible.

Developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung (and others), Matter is an open-sourced, IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol Thread and currently supports over 30 device types. These include lighting, thermostats, locks, robot vacuums, refrigerators, dishwashers, dryers, ovens, smoke alarms, air quality monitors, EV chargers, and more.

A smart home gadget with the Matter logo can be set up and used with any Matter-compatible ecosystem via a Matter controller and controlled by more than one with a feature called Multi-Admin.

Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some major smart home platforms supporting Matter, along with hundreds of device manufacturers.

While this is good news for Apple Home users with Nanoleaf products (and likely Hue ones, too), it’s also exciting for those with other brands of smart lights. “I believe that the vision for Adaptive Lighting is to be open to all partners that work with the Apple Home ecosystem via Matter,” said Chu.

That means Matter-compatible lighting products, including those from companies like Govee, Lifx, Wiz, and Linkind, could also work with the feature through Apple Home. The more compatible products there are, the easier (and cheaper) it will be to use Adaptive Lighting throughout your home.

Adaptive Lighting is an Apple Home exclusive feature and is not part of the Matter spec. This means it won’t work in other Matter-compatible ecosystems, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home. However, the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the organization that runs Matter, has previously said that more advanced lighting features similar to Adaptive Lighting and the dynamic lighting effects companies like Nanoleaf and Govee use are on its roadmap. If that happens, then those would work across all compatible platforms.
