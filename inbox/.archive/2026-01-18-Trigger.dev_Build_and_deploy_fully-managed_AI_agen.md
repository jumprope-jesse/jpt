- The emphasis on long-running tasks with retries and observability means less stress about managing background jobs, giving you more time to spend with family or pursue hobbies.
- The integration with existing Node.js SDKs means you can leverage your existing coding knowledge to enhance your projects without a steep learning curve.
- The platform’s ability to handle complex AI processes like prompt chaining and routing can inspire innovative solutions, whether it's for enhancing your business operations or personal projects.

Trigger.dev is redefining background jobs for modern developers.Paul Copplestone

We're using Trigger for our billing, background jobs and deployment pipeline without worrying about operations or infrastructure. It just works.Andreas Thomas

Trigger.dev is one of those tools that you set up once (takes like 30 minutes) and then never have to worry about again. We use it heavily at Magic Patterns and wish we used it earlier. Previously, we had a homegrown cron job solution.. not good.
Read Magic Patterns' customer story Alex Danilowicz

With Trigger.dev, we’ve summarized over a million student interactions in just a couple of weeks. We’re incredibly thankful for tools like Trigger.dev that are empowering us to bring AI-driven solutions to educators and students at scale.

We have critical business functionalities that need to be reliable and replayable in the event of a failure. Trigger.dev helps us deliver messages over WhatsApp, run thousands of jobs with custom LLM workflows, and execute ETL processes to sync our data across multiple databases without breaking a sweat!Patryk Maron

The first time I used Trigger.dev, I had an a-ha moment, I no longer needed to set up everything with ECS or Lambda. What also stands out is the exceptional support, unlike any I've seen in the web community.Martin Ruzicka

We’ve been looking for a product like Trigger.dev for a long time - automation that's simple and dev-focused.Han Wang

Trigger.dev is a breath of fresh air in a world of 20 second lambda timeouts. Trigger has world-class DX, support, and handles my long-running jobs with ease.Ian Janicki

I’m in love with Trigger.dev – it’s so much better than the old bull.js + heroku + redis setup that I used to use. You’ve knocked it out of the park with this tool!Kushal Byatnal

The platform transformed my workflow, I'm thrilled with it! Migrating my agentic workflow from Python to Trigger.dev has been a major win. Rare to find powerful features paired with such responsive assistance.

Trigger has completely transformed our video pipelines; we can now process thousands of videos in a catalog at once using FFmpeg, and our video ad generation time has dropped to sub-5 minutes by taking advantage of parallel-processing.

The reliability of Trigger.dev's job scheduling has been essential as we've scaled our evidence collection automation and built our open source community of 600+ compliance professionals.
Read Comp AI's customer story Lewis Carhart

We needed a sophisticated event engine: chaining LLM queries, orchestrating responses, async tasks, persistent state (without long lived servers), complex concurrency, and variable compute power. Trigger’s managed infra and intuitive SDK allowed us to migrate our entire events engine in a day (with incredible support from the team).Michael Parker

Trigger is a central part of our architecture. It’s allowed us to build a resilient system to orchestrates data across multiple systems. We love its observability, replayability, and how easily it slots into our existing codebase. It allows us to refine over time how to set the boundaries between async tasks and synchronous business logic.Agree Ahmed

Trigger.dev is undoubtedly one of my most cherished services. Throughout my two-decade career, it’s rare to encounter a product or service that truly resonates and makes a significant impact. It just clicks - an absolute game-changer for us. The support is beyond exceptional, and they genuinely care about the product and their users. I wholeheartedly recommend Trigger!Aaron J. Spurlock

Trigger.dev has become my go-to tool for new projects. I no longer need an additional server and can forget about horizontal scaling!Nevo David

For AI powered products, Trigger.dev is my clear go-to tool for building robust serverless pipelines stitching together various LLM calls.Evan Sandler

Trigger is packaging end-to-end cron, queues and webhooks platform in a slick interface. Integration was quick and we love the support ❤️Aseem Gupta

The Trigger.dev developer experience is unparalleled for building durable agents. Queues, streaming, retries, logging and more, all with just a few lines of code.Justin Sun
Capy

Trigger.dev was the missing piece in our journey to go fully serverless. It enables us to focus entirely on building our product without worrying about the complexities of background jobs. The best part? We’re continuously adding more jobs as we scale!

We found software that's open-source friendly called MuPDF which runs in Node.js environments. Combined with using Trigger's tasks and runs, it solved our problem instantly. We are now easily processing around 6,000 documents per month anywhere from one page to hundreds of pages.Marc Seitz

Using Trigger.dev for our Slack jobs saved us loads of time! It was much easier to set up than a no-code tool.Vlad Matsiiako

We decided to use Trigger.dev over Inngest or setting up our own dedicated solution. We had also looked into UI-based solutions like Zapier and n8n, but they become complex, really slow, expensive and time-consuming to manage for large automations. Trigger.dev made the most overall sense for us when taking dev-speed, cost, scalability and being future-proof into account.Sohrab Fadai

Trigger.dev helps us process bounties & tips on Algora without having to duct-tape queues & crons. With standardized timeouts, retries & logging we get full resilience & observability!Zaf Cesur
Algora

I really enjoyed using Trigger.dev to create jobs through code. I found the API integrations and scheduling features super useful.Adam Shiervani

We love Trigger.dev and it’s had a big impact in dev iteration velocity already.André Neves
