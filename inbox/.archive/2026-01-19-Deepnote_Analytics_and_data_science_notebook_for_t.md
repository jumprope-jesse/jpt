Developer

> I just love how SQL is now a first-class citizen in Deepnote notebooks! 🔥 It is SO easy to query databases!

> It's sped up our testing and staging immensely. Deepnote feels more or less like developing locally on your computer, but since it's in the cloud and hosted, it's typically a step closer to being demoed and “shown off” than it would be if it were just local.
