# [2401.08500] Code Generation with AlphaCodium: From Prompt Engineering to Flow Engineering

## AI Summary (from Notion)
- The document discusses a new approach to code generation called AlphaCodium.
- AlphaCodium is characterized as a test-based, multi-stage, code-oriented iterative flow.
- It addresses the unique challenges of code generation, which differ from typical natural language tasks.
- Key challenges in code generation include matching the exact syntax of the target language, identifying happy paths and edge cases, and adhering to specific problem requirements.
- The effectiveness of common natural language generation optimizations may not apply to code generation tasks.
- AlphaCodium was tested on a dataset called CodeContests, featuring competitive programming problems.
- Results showed a significant improvement in accuracy: GPT-4's performance increased from 19% to 44% on the validation set using the AlphaCodium approach.
- The principles derived from this work are considered broadly applicable to general code generation tasks.
- Full implementation details for AlphaCodium are available for further exploration.

> Code generation problems differ from common natural language problems - they require matching the exact syntax of the target language, identifying happy paths and edge cases, paying attention to numerous small details in the problem spec, and addressing other code-specific issues and requirements. Hence, many of the optimizations and tricks that have been successful in natural language generation may not be effective for code tasks. In this work, we propose a new approach to code generation by LLMs, which we call AlphaCodium - a test-based, multi-stage, code-oriented iterative flow, that improves the performances of LLMs on code problems. We tested AlphaCodium on a challenging code generation dataset called CodeContests, which includes competitive programming problems from platforms such as Codeforces. The proposed flow consistently and significantly improves results. On the validation set, for example, GPT-4 accuracy (pass@5) increased from 19% with a single well-designed direct prompt to 44% with the AlphaCodium flow. Many of the principles and best practices acquired in this work, we believe, are broadly applicable to general code generation tasks. Full implementation is available at:
