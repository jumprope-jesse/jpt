Amazon CodeCatalyst now offers a new capability powered by Amazon Q to help customers analyze issues and recommend granular tasks. These tasks can then be individually assigned to users or to Amazon Q itself, helping you accelerate work. Before, customers could create issues to track work that needs to be done on a project and they needed to manually create more granular tasks that can be assigned to others on the team. Now customers can ask Amazon Q to analyze an issue for complexity and suggest ways of breaking up the work into individual tasks.

This capability is available in the PDX region. For more information, see the documentation or visit the Amazon CodeCatalyst website.
