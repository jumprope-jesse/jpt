# Conspiracy Theorists Aren't Ignorant. They're Bad At Epistemology. — LessWrong

## Overview (from Notion)
- Understanding the cognitive biases and epistemological failures of conspiracy theorists can enhance your critical thinking skills, especially when making decisions for your family or business.
- The article highlights the importance of recognizing that knowledge does not always equate to sound reasoning; this can inform your approach to hiring or collaborating with others in your company.
- It illustrates the challenge of engaging with people who hold unconventional beliefs, emphasizing the need for patience and well-structured arguments rather than dismissiveness.
- The narrative encourages seeking out deeper understanding and evidence rather than accepting surface-level explanations, which is crucial in both parenting and business.
- Alternate views could focus on the societal and psychological factors that lead individuals to conspiracy theories—considering this can help you communicate more effectively with diverse perspectives in your community.
- The idea that most people reject conspiracy theories out of conformity can prompt you to reflect on your own beliefs and how they align with or challenge mainstream views.
- Recognizing the value of higher-order evidence might inspire you to foster a culture of inquiry and skepticism in your household or team, promoting a more analytical approach to problems.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Conspiracy theorists often possess extensive knowledge but struggle with critical thinking and epistemology, leading them to accept improbable theories. This challenges the notion that they are simply ignorant, as they can argue effectively on specific topics, making it difficult to counter their claims without a deep understanding of the subject matter.

Cross-post of my blog article on the topic.

I probably know less about science than most people who think the earth is flat do.

Okay, that’s not quite true. I have knowledge of lots of claims of science—that the big bang happened, that evolution is true, that the earth is round, etc—that people who think the earth is flat don’t have. But in terms of my knowledge of the science surrounding how one shows the roundness of the earth, I, like most people who think the earth is round, probably know less about it than most people who think the earth is flat.

People are often baffled by the widespread success of conspiracy theories. Among well-educated liberals, for instance, there’s a common attitude that conspiracy theorists are just deeply ignorant about various facts. One might say something like “how do conspiracy theorists believe X when Y.” Yet if one actually talks to a conspiracy theorist, they’ll have something to say about Y—likely something that is hard to refute on the fly.

The problem with conspiracy theorists is not that they’re ignorant of a few basic facts. They often have a shockingly large store of knowledge—just watch a debate with this guy, for example. It’s that they are bad at thinking. They accept improbable theories, largely neglect higher-order evidence, and are bad at judging the plausibility of a view.

There was a guy who would often come to my campus to yell about the earth being flat. I’m sure he could win an argument on that topic with most random people—for he came with real arguments. They were not good arguments, but he had more things to say than most people. The problem with his thinking was not that he was ignorant of a basic fact, but that he thought that positing a global conspiracy with thousands of actors that has somehow been ascertained by disproportionately scientifically illiterate internet sleuths was a better theory than thinking that there is some unknown explanation for apparently strange features of water.

At one point, for instance, he started talking about there being two different kinds of eclipses that only makes sense if the earth is flat. The reason non-conspiracy theorists reject this is not that they have some specialized knowledge about eclipses, but because they accept, based on higher-order evidence, that there’s not some deep hole in our understanding of eclipses that has eluded all the top science journals.

This is why it’s very difficult to argue with conspiracy theorists. They probably know more about the subject than you do—and it’s hard to argue in a debate from higher-order evidence. Mostly the reason not to believe conspiracy theories is that the experts don’t, and it’s likelier you are wrong than that they are.

Yet failure to recognize this fact leads inexorably to people smugly dismissing conspiracy theorists as ignorant rubes. No, they’re not ignorant rubes. They’re bad epistemology rubes. As Scott Alexander says:

> When I was a teenager I believed in a conspiracy theory. It was the one Graham Hancock wrote about in Fingerprints Of The Gods, sort of a modern update on the Atlantis story. It went something like this:

This is very right! The reason I reject the Atlantis theory is not that I have some specific explanation of all the stories about lost continents, but it’s that I estimate the probability of there being some explanation out there as quite high.

Yet people have this hubristic notion that they know more than the conspiracy theorists, that they’d never fall for a conspiracy theory because they can do basic googling. This is not true. The reason most people reject conspiracy theories is that they are conformists—they just believe things that sound normal. This is a pretty good heuristic for forming true beliefs—if smart people mostly think your belief is crazy then it probably is. But it’s a huge mistake to think that you have identified the specific object-level reasons most conspiracy theories are wrong.

Not only does this hubris lead to people like Scott getting trapped believing in conspiracy theories for decades, it makes it so that when people end up debating conspiracy theorists, they get crushed. A recent hilarious example was a debate between YouTuber Tom Jump and Ryan Dawson. Dawson thinks that the Israeli and U.S. governments were intimately involved in 9/11.

Mr. Jump seemed to think it was a good idea to go into a debate with a guy who has been obsessively looking over a topic for 20 years with no prep. As a result, he was completely trounced, even though his position was probably correct. He didn’t appreciate the difficulty of arguing with a conspiracy theorist on the facts.

Conspiracy theories are mostly improbable. But arguing with them on the object level—haggling over the details of what happened on 9/11, for instance—is very difficult and requires a truly vast array of knowledge. The average person cannot do it, and the idea that conspiracy theorists are just ignorant of basic facts is a delusion that people cling in order to feel superior. The truth is, most conspiracy theorists probably know more about the topics that they discuss than you do.
