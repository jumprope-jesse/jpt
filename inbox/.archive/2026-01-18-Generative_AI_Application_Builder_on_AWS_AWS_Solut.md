## Overview

Generative AI Application Builder on AWS facilitates the development, rapid experimentation, and deployment of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications without requiring deep experience in AI. This AWS Solution accelerates development and streamlines experimentation by helping you ingest your business-specific data and documents, evaluate and compare the performance of large language models (LLMs), rapidly build extensible applications, and deploy those applications with an enterprise-grade architecture.

Generative AI Application Builder on AWS includes integrations with Amazon Bedrock and its included LLMs, and LLMs deployed on Amazon SageMaker. Additionally, this solution has pre-built connectors to providers such as Anthropic and Hugging Face and enables connections to your choice of model using LangChain or AWS Lambda. Start with the no-code deployment wizard to build generative AI applications for conversational search, AI-generated chatbots, text generation, and text summarization.
