## Built for enterprise scale

Buster is designed for organizations that prioritize performance and security.

Buster connects to your database with read-only access. You have complete control of which tables or columns users can query, ensuring the security of your sensitive data. You can also allowlist our IP addresses or connect via SSH.

Buster provides granular access controls, allowing you to route users to their specific tenant or define row-level access. Access controls are implemented through a deterministic access control layer to ensure reliability and security.

By default, we will never store any of your database data. Though not required, you can choose to store non-PII string values in a vector store. This allows you to maintain complete control over your data while still benefiting from enhanced performance.
