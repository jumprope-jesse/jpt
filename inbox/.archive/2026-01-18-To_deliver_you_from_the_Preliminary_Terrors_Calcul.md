## Content (from Notion)

The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply stating what is the meaning–in common-sense terms–of the two principal symbols that are used in calculating.

These dreadful symbols are:

(1) d which merely means “a little bit of.”

Thus dx means a little bit of x; or du means a little bit of u. Ordinary mathematicians think it more polite to say “an element of,” instead of “a little bit of.” Just as you please. But you will find that these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be indefinitely small.

(2) ∫ which is merely a long S, and may be called (if you like) “the sum of.”

Thus ∫dx means the sum of all the little bits of x; or ∫dt means the sum of all the little bits of t. Ordinary mathematicians call this symbol “the integral of.” Now any fool can see that if x is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called dx, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the dx's, (which is the same thing as the whole of x). The word “integral” simply means “the whole.” If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.

When you see an expression that begins with this terrifying symbol, you will henceforth know that it is put there merely to give you instructions that you are now to perform the operation (if you can) of totalling up all the little bits that are indicated by the symbols that follow.

That's all.

We shall find that in our processes of calculation we have to deal with small quantities of various degrees of smallness.

We shall have also to learn under what circumstances we may consider small quantities to be so minute that we may omit them from consideration. Everything depends upon relative minuteness.

Before we fix any rules let us think of some familiar cases. There are 60 minutes in the hour, 24 hours in the day, 7 days in the week. There are therefore 1440 minutes in the day and 10080 minutes in the week.

Obviously 1 minute is a very small quantity of time compared with a whole week. Indeed, our forefathers considered it small as compared with an hour, and called it “one minùte,” meaning a minute fraction–namely one sixtieth–of an hour. When they came to require still smaller subdivisions of time, they divided each minute into 60 still smaller parts, which, in Queen Elizabeth's days, they called “second minùtes” (i.e.: small quantities of the second order of minuteness). Nowadays we call these small quantities of the second order of smallness “seconds.” But few people know why they are so called.

Now if one minute is so small as compared with a whole day, how much smaller by comparison is one second!

Again, think of a farthing as compared with a sovereign: it is barely worth more than 11000 part. A farthing more or less is of precious little importance compared with a sovereign: it may certainly be regarded as a small quantity. But compare a farthing with £1000: relatively to this greater sum, the farthing is of no more importance than 11000 of a farthing would be to a sovereign. Even a golden sovereign is relatively a negligible quantity in the wealth of a millionaire.

Now if we fix upon any numerical fraction as constituting the proportion which for any purpose we call relatively small, we can easily state other fractions of a higher degree of smallness. Thus if, for the purpose of time, 1 be called a small fraction, then 1 of 160 (being a small fraction of a small fraction) may be regarded as a small quantity of the second order of smallness.*

- The mathematicians talk about the second order of “magnitude” (i.e.: greatness) when they really mean second order of smallness. This is very confusing to beginners.
Or, if for any purpose we were to take 1 per cent. (i.e.: 1) as a small fraction, then 1 per cent. of 1 per cent. (i.e.: 110,000) would be a small fraction of the second order of smallness; and 11,000,000 would be a small fraction of the third order of smallness, being 1 per cent. of 1 per cent. of 1 per cent.

Lastly, suppose that for some very precise purpose we should regard 11,000,000 as “small.” Thus, if a first-rate chronometer is not to lose or gain more than half a minute in a year, it must keep time with an accuracy of 1 part in 1,051,200. Now if, for such a purpose, we regard 11,000,000 (or one millionth) as a small quantity, then 11,000,000 of 11,000,000, that is 11,000,000,000,000 (or one billionth†) will be a small quantity of the second order of smallness, and may be utterly disregarded, by comparison.

Then we see that the smaller a small quantity itself is, the more negligible does the corresponding small quantity of the second order become. Hence we know that in all cases we are justified in neglecting the small quantities of the second–or third (or higher)–orders, if only we take the small quantity of the first order small enough in itself.

But, it must be remembered, that small quantities if they occur in our expressions as factors multiplied by some other factor, may become important if the other factor is itself large. Even a farthing becomes important if only it is multiplied by a few hundred.

Now in the calculus we write dx for a little bit of x. These things such as dx, and du, and dy, are called “differentials,” the differential of x, or of u, or of y, as the case may be. [You read them as dee-eks, or dee-you, or dee-wy.] If dx be a small bit of x, and relatively small of itself, it does not follow that such quantities as x·dx, or x2dx, or axdx are negligible. But dx×dx would be negligible, being a small quantity of the second order.

A very simple example will serve as illustration.

Let us think of x as a quantity that can grow by a small amount so as to become x+dx, where dx is the small increment added by growth. The square of this is x2+2x·dx+(dx)2. The second term is not negligible because it is a first-order quantity; while the third term is of the second order of smallness, being a bit of, a bit of x2. Thus if we took dx to mean numerically, say, 1 of x, then the second term would be 2 of x2, whereas the third term would be 13600 of x2. This last term is clearly less important than the second. But if we go further and take dx to mean only 1 of x, then the second term will be 2 of x2, while the third term will be only 11,000,000 of x2.

Geometrically this may be depicted as follows: Draw a square (Figure 1) the side of which we will take to represent x. Now suppose the square to grow by having a bit dx added to its size each way. The enlarged square is made up of the original square x2, the two rectangles at the top and on the right, each of which is of area x·dx (or together 2x·dx), and the little square at the top right-hand corner which is (dx)2. In Figure 2 we have taken dx as quite a big fraction of x–about 1. But suppose we had taken it only 1–about the thickness of an inked line drawn with a fine pen. Then the little corner square will have an area of only 110,000 of x2, and be practically invisible. Clearly (dx)2 is negligible if only we consider the increment dx to be itself small enough.

Let us consider a simile.

Suppose a millionaire were to say to his secretary: next week I will give you a small fraction of any money that comes in to me. Suppose that the secretary were to say to his boy: I will give you a small fraction of what I get. Suppose the fraction in each case to be 1100 part. Now if Mr. Millionaire received during the next week £1000, the secretary would receive £10 and the boy 2 shillings. Ten pounds would be a small quantity compared with £1000; but two shillings is a small small quantity indeed, of a very secondary order. But what would be the disproportion if the fraction, instead of being 1100, had been settled at 11000 part? Then, while Mr. Millionaire got his £1000, Mr. Secretary would get only £1, and the boy less than one farthing!

The witty Dean Swift* once wrote:

> So, Nat'ralists observe, a Flea
Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey.
And these have smaller Fleas to bite 'em,
And so proceed ad infinitum."

- On Poetry: a Rhapsody (p. 20), printed 1733–usually misquoted.
An ox might worry about a flea of ordinary size–a small creature of the first order of smallness. But he would probably not trouble himself about a flea's flea; being of the second order of smallness, it would be negligible. Even a gross of fleas' fleas would not be of much account to the ox.

†The term billion here means 1012 in old British English, ie, trillion in modern use.

All through the calculus we are dealing with quantities that are growing, and with rates of growth. We classify all quantities into two classes: constants and variables. Those which we regard as of fixed value, and call constants, we generally denote algebraically by letters from the beginning of the alphabet, such as a, b, or c; while those which we consider as capable of growing, or (as mathematicians say) of “varying,” we denote by letters from the end of the alphabet, such as x, y, z, u, v, w, or sometimes t.

Moreover, we are usually dealing with more than one variable at once, and thinking of the way in which one variable depends on the other: for instance, we think of the way in which the height reached by a projectile depends on the time of attaining that height. Or we are asked to consider a rectangle of given area, and to enquire how any increase in the length of it will compel a corresponding decrease in the breadth of it. Or we think of the way in which any variation in the slope of a ladder will cause the height that it reaches, to vary.

Suppose we have got two such variables that depend one on the other. An alteration in one will bring about an alteration in the other, because of this dependence. Let us call one of the variables x, and the other that depends on it y.

Suppose we make x to vary, that is to say, we either alter it or imagine it to be altered, by adding to it a bit which we call dx. We are thus causing x to become x+dx. Then, because x has been altered, y will have altered also, and will have become y+dy. Here the bit dy may be in some cases positive, in others negative; and it won't (except by a miracle) be the same size as dx.

Take two examples.

(1) Let x and y be respectively the base and the height of a right-angled triangle (Figure 4), of which the slope of the other side is fixed at . If we suppose this triangle to expand and yet keep its angles the same as at first, then, when the base grows so as to become , the height becomes . Here, increasing  results in an increase of . The little triangle, the height of which is , and the base of which is , is similar to the original triangle; and it is obvious that the value of the ratio  is the same as that of the ratio . As the angle is  it will be seen that here

(2) Let  represent, in Figure 5, the horizontal distance, from a wall, of the bottom end of a ladder, , of fixed length; and let  be the height it reaches up the wall. Now  clearly depends on . It is easy to see that, if we pull the bottom end  a bit further from the wall, the top end  will come down a little lower. Let us state this in scientific language. If we increase  to , then  will become ; that is, when  receives a positive increment, the increment which results to  is negative.

Yes, but how much? Suppose the ladder was so long that when the bottom end  was  inches from the wall the top end  reached just  feet from the ground. Now, if you were to pull the bottom end out  inch more, how much would the top end come down? Put it all into inches:  inches,  inches. Now the increment of  which we call , is  inch: or  inches.

How much will  be diminished? The new height will be . If we work out the height by Euclid I. 47, then we shall be able to find how much  will be. The length of the ladder is  Clearly then, the new height, which is , will be such that  Now  is , so that  is  inch.

So we see that making  an increase of  inch has resulted in making  a decrease of  inch.

And the ratio of  to  may be stated thus:

It is also easy to see that (except in one particular position)  will be of a different size from .

Now right through the differential calculus we are hunting, hunting, hunting for a curious thing, a mere ratio, namely, the proportion which  bears to  when both of them are indefinitely small.

It should be noted here that we can only find this ratio  when  and  are related to each other in some way, so that whenever  varies  does vary also. For instance, in the first example just taken, if the base  of the triangle be made longer, the height  of the triangle becomes greater also, and in the second example, if the distance  of the foot of the ladder from the wall be made to increase, the height  reached by the ladder decreases in a corresponding manner, slowly at first, but more and more rapidly as  becomes greater. In these cases the relation between  and  is perfectly definite, it can be expressed mathematically, being  and  (where  is the length of the ladder) respectively, and  has the meaning we found in each case.

If, while  is, as before, the distance of the foot of the ladder from the wall,  is, instead of the height reached, the horizontal length of the wall, or the number of bricks in it, or the number of years since it was built, any change in  would naturally cause no change whatever in ; in this case  has no meaning whatever, and it is not possible to find an expression for it. Whenever we use differentials , , , etc., the existence of some kind of relation between , , , etc., is implied, and this relation is called a “function” in , , , etc.; the two expressions given above, for instance, namely  and , are functions of  and . Such expressions contain implicitly (that is, contain without distinctly showing it) the means of expressing either  in terms of  or  in terms of , and for this reason they are called implicit functions in  and ; they can be respectively put into the forms

These last expressions state explicitly (that is, distinctly) the value of  in terms of , or of  in terms of , and they are for this reason called explicit functions of  or . For example  is an implicit function in  and ; it may be written  (explicit function of ) or  (explicit function of ). We see that an explicit function in , , , etc., is simply something the value of which changes when , , , etc., are changing, either one at the time or several together. Because of this, the value of the explicit function is called the dependent variable, as it depends on the value of the other variable quantities in the function; these other variables are called the independent variables because their value is not determined from the value assumed by the function. For example, if ,  and  are the independent variables, and  is the dependent variable.

Sometimes the exact relation between several quantities , ,  either is not known or it is not convenient to state it; it is only known, or convenient to state, that there is some sort of relation between these variables, so that one cannot alter either  or  or  singly without affecting the other quantities; the existence of a function in , ,  is then indicated by the notation  (implicit function) or by ,  or  (explicit function). Sometimes the letter  or  is used instead of , so that ,  and  all mean the same thing, namely, that the value of  depends on the value of  in some way which is not stated.

We call the ratio  “the differential coefficient of  with respect to .” It is a solemn scientific name for this very simple thing. But we are not going to be frightened by solemn names, when the things themselves are so easy. Instead of being frightened we will simply pronounce a brief curse on the stupidity of giving long crack-jaw names; and, having relieved our minds, will go on to the simple thing itself, namely the ratio .

In ordinary algebra which you learned at school, you were always hunting after some unknown quantity which you called  or ; or sometimes there were two unknown quantities to be hunted for simultaneously. You have now to learn to go hunting in a new way; the fox being now neither  nor . Instead of this you have to hunt for this curious cub called . The process of finding the value of  is called “differentiating.” But, remember, what is wanted is the value of this ratio when both  and  are themselves indefinitely small. The true value of the differential coefficient is that to which it approximates in the limiting case when each of them is considered as infinitesimally minute.

Let us now learn how to go in quest of .

## NOTE TO CHAPTER III.

## How to read Differentials.

It will never do to fall into the schoolboy error of thinking that  means  times , for  is not a factor–it means “an element of” or “a bit of” whatever follows. One reads  thus: “dee-eks.”
In case the reader has no one to guide him in such matters it may here be simply said that one reads differential coefficients in the following way. The differential coefficient  is read “dee-wy by dee-eks,” or “dee-wy over dee-eks.”

 So also  is read “dee-you by dee-tee.”
Second differential coefficients will be met with later on. They are like this:  which is read “dee-two-wy over dee-eks-squared,” and it means that the operation of differentiating  with respect to  has been (or has to be) performed twice over.

Another way of indicating that a function has been differentiated is by putting an accent to the symbol of the function. Thus if , which means that  is some unspecified function of  (see here), we may write  instead of . Similarly,  will mean that the original function F(x) has been differentiated twice over with respect to x.

Now let us see how, on first principles, we can differentiate some simple algebraical expression.

### Case 1

Let us begin with the simple expression y=x2. Now remember that the fundamental notion about the calculus is the idea of growing. Mathematicians call it varying. Now as y and x2 are equal to one another, it is clear that if x grows, x2 will also grow. And if x2 grows, then y will also grow. What we have got to find out is the proportion between the growing of y and the growing of x. In other words our task is to find out the ratio between dy and dx, or, in brief, to find the value of dydx.

Let x, then, grow a little bit bigger and become x+dx; similarly, y will grow a bit bigger and will become y+dy. Then, clearly, it will still be true that the enlarged y will be equal to the square of the enlarged x. Writing this down, we have: y+dy=(x+dx)2.Doing the squaring we get:y+dy=x2+2x·dx+(dx)2.

What does (dx)2 mean? Remember that dx meant a bit–a little bit–of x. Then (dx)2 will mean a little bit of a little bit of x; that is, as explained above (here), it is a small quantity of the second order of smallness. It may therefore be discarded as quite inconsiderable in comparison with the other terms. Leaving it out, we then have: y+dy=x2+2x·dx.Now y=x2; so let us subtract this from the equation and we have leftdy=2x·dx. Dividing across by dx, we finddydx=2x.

Now this* is what we set out to find. The ratio of the growing of y to the growing of x is, in the case before us, found to be 2x.

- Note–This ratio dydx is the result of differentiating y with respect to x. Differentiating means finding the differential coefficient. Suppose we had some other function of x, as, for example, u=7x2+3. Then if we were told to differentiate this with respect to x, we should have to find dudx, or, what is the same thing, d(7x2+3)dx. On the other hand, we may have a case in which time was the independent variable (see here), such as this: y=b+1at2. Then, if we were told to differentiate it, that means we must find its differential coefficient with respect to t. So that then our business would be to try to find dydt, that is, to find d(b+1at2)dt.
Numerical example.

Suppose x=100 and . Then let  grow till it becomes  (that is, let ). Then the enlarged  will be . But if we agree that we may ignore small quantities of the second order,  may be rejected as compared with ; so we may round off the enlarged  to .  has grown from  to ; the bit added on is , which is therefore .

. According to the algebra-working of the previous paragraph, we find . And so it is; for  and .

But, you will say, we neglected a whole unit.

Well, try again, making  a still smaller bit.

Try . Then , and

Now the last figure  is only one-millionth part of the , and is utterly negligible; so we may take  without the little decimal at the end. And this makes ; and , which is still the same as .

### Case 2

Try differentiating  in the same way.

We let  grow to , while  grows to .

Then we have

Doing the cubing we obtain

Now we know that we may neglect small quantities of the second and third orders; since, when  and  are both made indefinitely small,  and  will become indefinitely smaller by comparison. So, regarding them as negligible, we have left:

But ; and, subtracting this, we have:

### Case 3

Try differentiating . Starting as before by letting both  and  grow a bit, we have:  Working out the raising to the fourth power, we get  Then striking out the terms containing all the higher powers of , as being negligible by comparison, we have  Subtracting the original , we have left

Now all these cases are quite easy. Let us collect the results to see if we can infer any general rule. Put them in two columns, the values of  in one and the corresponding values found for  in the other: thus

Just look at these results: the operation of differentiating appears to have had the effect of diminishing the power of  by  (for example in the last case reducing  to ), and at the same time multiplying by a number (the same number in fact which originally appeared as the power). Now, when you have once seen this, you might easily conjecture how the others will run. You would expect that differentiating  would give , or differentiating  would give . If you hesitate, try one of these, and see whether the conjecture comes right.

Try .

Neglecting all the terms containing small quantities of the higher orders, we have left

Following out logically our observation, we should conclude that if we want to deal with any higher power,–call it –we could tackle it in the same way.

Let

then, we should expect to find that

.

For example, let , then ; and differentiating it would give .

And, indeed, the rule that differentiating  gives as the result  is true for all cases where  is a whole number and positive. [Expanding  by the binomial theorem will at once show this.] But the question whether it is true for cases where  has negative or fractional values requires further consideration.

Case of a negative power.

Let . Then proceed as before:  Expanding this by the binomial theorem (see here), we get  So, neglecting the small quantities of higher orders of smallness, we have:  Subtracting the original , we find  And this is still in accordance with the rule inferred above.

Case of a fractional power.

Let . Then, as before,

Subtracting the original , and neglecting higher powers we have left:  and . Agreeing with the general rule.

Summary. Let us see how far we have got. We have arrived at the following rule: To differentiate , multiply by the power and reduce the power by one, so giving us  as the result.

In our equations we have regarded x as growing, and as a result of x being made to grow y also changed its value and grew. We usually think of x as a quantity that we can vary; and, regarding the variation of x as a sort of cause, we consider the resulting variation of y as an effect. In other words, we regard the value of y as depending on that of x. Both x and y are variables, but x is the one that we operate upon, and y is the “dependent variable.” In all the preceding chapter we have been trying to find out rules for the proportion which the dependent variation in y bears to the variation independently made in x.

Our next step is to find out what effect on the process of differentiating is caused by the presence of constants, that is, of numbers which don't change when x or y change their values.

Added Constants.

Let us begin with some simple case of an added constant, thus: Let y=x3+5. Just as before, let us suppose x to grow to x+dx and y to grow to y+dy. Then:y+dy=(x+dx)3+5=x3+3x2dx+3x(dx)2+(dx)3+5. Neglecting the small quantities of higher orders, this becomes y+dy=x3+3x2·dx+5. Subtract the original y=x3+5, and we have left: dy=3x2dx.dydx=3x2.

So the 5 has quite disappeared. It added nothing to the growth of x, and does not enter into the differential coefficient. If we had put 7, or 700, or any other number, instead of 5, it would have disappeared. So if we take the letter a, or b, or c to represent any constant, it will simply disappear when we differentiate.

If the additional constant had been of negative value, such as −5 or −b, it would equally have disappeared.

Multiplied Constants.

Take as a simple experiment this case:

Let y=7x2. Then on proceeding as before we get: y+dy=7(x+dx)2=7{x2+2x·dx+(dx)2}=7x2+14x·dx+7(dx)2. Then, subtracting the original y=7x2, and neglecting the last term, we have dy=14x·dx.dydx=14x.

Let us illustrate this example by working out the graphs of the equations y=7x2 and dydx=14x, by assigning to x a set of successive values, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and finding the corresponding values of y and of dydx.

These values we tabulate as follows:

Now plot these values to some convenient scale, and we obtain the two curves, Fig. 6 and Fig. 6a.

Carefully compare the two figures, and verify by inspection that the height of the ordinate of the derived curve, Fig. 6a, is proportional to the slope of the original curve, (See here about slopes of curves.) Figure 6, at the corresponding value of x. To the left of the origin, where the original curve slopes negatively (that is, downward from left to right) the corresponding ordinates of the derived curve are negative.

Now if we look back at here, we shall see that simply differentiating x2 gives us 2x. So that the differential coefficient of 7x2 is just 7 times as big as that of x2. If we had taken 8x2, the differential coefficient would have come out eight times as great as that of x2. If we put y=ax2, we shall get dydx=a×2x.

If we had begun with y=axn, we should have had dydx=a×nxn−1. So that any mere multiplication by a constant reappears as a mere multiplication when the thing is differentiated. And, what is true about multiplication is equally true about division: for if, in the example above, we had taken as the constant 1 instead of 7, we should have had the same 1 come out in the result after differentiation.

Some Further Examples. The following further examples, fully worked out, will enable you to master completely the process of differentiation as applied to ordinary algebraical expressions, and enable you to work out by yourself the examples given at the end of this chapter.

(1) Differentiate y=x5−35.

35 is an added constant and vanishes (see here).

We may then write at once dydx=17×5×x5−1,ordydx=57x4.

(2) Differentiate y=a√x−12√a.

The term 12√a vanishes, being an added constant; and as a√x, in the index form, is written ax12, we have dydx=a×12×x12−1=a2×x−12,ordydx=a.

(3) If ay+bx=by−ax+(x+y)√a2−b2, find the differential coefficient of y with respect to x.

As a rule an expression of this kind will need a little more knowledge than we have acquired so far; it is, however, always worth while to try whether the expression can be put in a simpler form.

First we must try to bring it into the form y= some expression involving x only.

The expression may be written (a−b)y+(a+b)x=(x+y)√a2−b2.

Squaring, we get (a−b)2y2+(a+b)2x2+2(a+b)(a−b)xy=(x2+y2+2xy)(a2−b2), which simplifies to (a−b)2y2+(a+b)2x2=x2(a2−b2)+y2(a2−b2); or[(a−b)2−(a2−b2)]y2=[(a2−b2)−(a+b)2]x2, that is2b(b−a)y2=−2b(b+a)x2; hence y=√a+ba−bxanddydx=√a+ba−b.

(4) The volume of a cylinder of radius r and height h is given by the formula V=πr2h. Find the rate of variation of volume with the radius when r=5.5 in. and h=20 in. If r=h, find the dimensions of the cylinder so that a change of 1 in. in radius causes a change of 400 cub. in. in the volume.

The rate of variation of V with regard to r is dVdr=2πrh.

If r=5.5 in. and h=20 in. this becomes 690.8. It means that a change of radius of 1 inch will cause a change of volume of 690.8 cub. inch. This can be easily verified, for the volumes with r=5 and r=6 are 1570 cub. in. and 2260.8 cub. in. respectively, and 2260.8−1570=690.8.

Also, if r=h,dVdr=2πr2=400andr=h=√=7.98in.

(5) The reading θ of a Féry's Radiation pyrometer is related to the Centigrade temperature t of the observed body by the relation θθ1=(tt1)4, where θ1 is the reading corresponding to a known temperature t1 of the observed body.

Compare the sensitiveness of the pyrometer at temperatures 800°C., 1000°C., 1200°C., given that it read 25 when the temperature was 1000°C.

The sensitiveness is the rate of variation of the reading with the temperature, that is dθdt. The formula may be written θ=t4=10004, and we have dθdt=10004=t310,000,000,000.

When t=800, 1000 and 1200, we get dθdt=0.0512, 0.1 and 0.1728 respectively.

The sensitiveness is approximately doubled from 800° to 1000°, and becomes three-quarters as great again up to 1200°.

We have learned how to differentiate simple algebraical functions such as x2+c or ax4, and we have now to consider how to tackle the sum of two or more functions.

For instance, let y=(x2+c)+(ax4+b);

what will its dydx be? How are we to go to work on this new job?

The answer to this question is quite simple: just differentiate them, one after the other, thus: dydx=2x+4ax3.(Ans.)

If you have any doubt whether this is right, try a more general case, working it by first principles. And this is the way.

Let y=u+v, where u is any function of x, and v any other function of x. Then, letting x increase to x+dx, y will increase to y+dy; and u will increase to u+du; and v to v+dv.

And we shall have:

y+dy=u+du+v+dv.

Subtracting the original y=u+v, we get

dy=du+dv,

and dividing through by dx, we get:

dydx=dudx+dvdx.

This justifies the procedure. You differentiate each function separately and add the results. So if now we take the example of the preceding paragraph, and put in the values of the two functions, we shall have, using the notation shown (chapter III), dydx=d(x2+c)dx+d(ax4+b)dx=2x+4ax3,

exactly as before.

If there were three functions of x, which we may call u, v and w, so that y=u+v+w;thendydx=dudx+dvdx+dwdx.

As for subtraction, it follows at once; for if the function v had itself had a negative sign, its differential coefficient would also be negative; so that by differentiating y=u−v, we should getdydx=dudx−dvdx.

But when we come to do with Products, the thing is not quite so simple.

Suppose we were asked to differentiate the expression y=(x2+c)×(ax4+b),

what are we to do? The result will certainly not be 2x×4ax3; for it is easy to see that neither c×ax4, nor x2×b, would have been taken into that product.

Now there are two ways in which we may go to work.

First way. Do the multiplying first, and, having worked it out, then differentiate.

Accordingly, we multiply together x2+c and ax4+b.

This gives ax6+acx4+bx2+bc.

Now differentiate, and we get: dydx=6ax5+4acx3+2bx.

Second way. Go back to first principles, and consider the equation y=u×v;

where u is one function of x, and v is any other function of x. Then, if x grows to be x+dx; and y to y+dy; and u becomes u+du, and v becomes v+dv, we shall have: y+dy=(u+du)×(v+dv)=u·v+u·dv+v·du+du·dv.

Now du·dv is a small quantity of the second order of smallness, and therefore in the limit may be discarded, leaving y+dy=u·v+u·dv+v·du.

Then, subtracting the original y=u·v, we have left dy=u·dv+v·du;

and, dividing through by dx, we get the result: dydx=udvdx+vdudx.

This shows that our instructions will be as follows: To differentiate the product of two functions, multiply each function by the differential coefficient of the other, and add together the two products so obtained.

You should note that this process amounts to the following: Treat u as constant while you differentiate v; then treat v as constant while you differentiate u; and the whole differential coefficient dydx will be the sum of these two treatments.

Now, having found this rule, apply it to the concrete example which was considered above.

We want to differentiate the product (x2+c)×(ax4+b).

Call (x2+c)=u; and (ax4+b)=v.

Then, by the general rule just established, we may write: dydx=(x2+c)d(ax4+b)dx+(ax4+b)d(x2+c)dx=(x2+c)4ax3+(ax4+b)2x=4ax5+4acx3+2ax5+2bx,dydx=6ax5+4acx3+2bx,

exactly as before.

Lastly, we have to differentiate quotients.

Think of this example, y=bx5+cx2+a. In such a case it is no use to try to work out the division beforehand, because x2+a will not divide into bx5+c, neither have they any common factor. So there is nothing for it but to go back to first principles, and find a rule. So we will put y=uv;

where u and v are two different functions of the independent variable x. Then, when x becomes x+dx, y will become y+dy; and u will become u+du; and v will become v+dv. So then y+dy=u+duv+dv.

Now perform the algebraic division, thus:

As both these remainders are small quantities of the second order, they may be neglected, and the division may stop here, since any further remainders would be of still smaller magnitudes.

So we have got: y+dy=uv+duv−u·dvv2;

which may be written =uv+v·du−u·dvv2. Now subtract the original y=uv, and we have left: dy=v·du−u·dvv2;whencedydx=vdudx−udvdxv2.

This gives us our instructions as to how to differentiate a quotient of two functions. Multiply the divisor function by the differential coefficient of the dividend function; then multiply the dividend function by the differential coefficient of the divisor function; and subtract. Lastly divide by the square of the divisor function.

Going back to our example y=bx5+cx2+a,  writebx5+c=u;andx2+a=v.

Then dydx=(x2+a)d(bx5+c)dx−(bx5+c)d(x2+a)dx(x2+a)2=(x2+a)(5bx4)−(bx5+c)(2x)(x2+a)2,dydx=3bx6+5abx4−2cx(x2+a)2.(Answer.)

The working out of quotients is often tedious, but there is nothing difficult about it.

Some further examples fully worked out are given hereafter.

(1) Differentiate y=ab2x3−a2bx+a2b2.

Being a constant, a2b2 vanishes, and we have dydx=ab2×3×x3−1−a2b×1×x1−1.

But x1−1=x0=1; so we get: dydx=3ab2x2−a2b.

(2) Differentiate y=2a√bx3−3b3√ax−2√ab.

Putting x in the index form, we get y=2a√bx32−3b3√ax−1−2√ab.

Now dydx=2a√b×32×x32−1−3b3√a×(−1)×x−1−1;or, dydx=3a√bx+3b3√ax2.

(3) Differentiate z=1.83√1θ2−4.45√θ−27°.

This may be written: z=1.8θ−23−4.4θ−15−27°.

The 27° vanishes, and we have dzdθ=1.8×−23×θ−23−1−4.4×(−15)θ−15−1;or,dzdθ=−1.2θ−53+0.88θ−65;or,dzdθ=0.885√θ6−1.23√θ5.

(4) Differentiate v=(3t2−1.2t+1)3.

A direct way of doing this will be explained later (see here); but we can nevertheless manage it now without any difficulty.

Developing the cube, we get v=27t6−32.4t5+39.96t4−23.328t3+13.32t2−3.6t+1;

hence dvdt=162t5−162t4+159.84t3−69.984t2+26.64t−3.6.

(5) Differentiate y=(2x−3)(x+1)2. dydx=(2x−3)d[(x+1)(x+1)]dx+(x+1)2d(2x−3)dx=(2x−3)[(x+1)d(x+1)dx+(x+1)d(x+1)dx]+(x+1)2d(2x−3)dx=2(x+1)[(2x−3)+(x+1)]=2(x+1)(3x−2)

or, more simply, multiply out and then differentiate.

(6) Differentiate y=0.5x3(x−3). dydx=0.5[x3d(x−3)dx+(x−3)d(x3)dx]=0.5[x3+(x−3)×3x2]=2x3−4.5x2.

Same remarks as for preceding example.

(7) Differentiate w=(θ+1θ)(√θ+1√θ).

This may be written w=(θ+θ−1)(θ12+θ−12).dwdθ=(θ+θ−1)d(θ12+θ−12)dθ+(θ12+θ−12)d(θ+θ−1)dθ=(θ+θ−1)(12θ−12−12θ−32)+(θ12+θ−12)(1−θ−2)=12(θ12+θ−32−θ−12−θ−52)+(θ12+θ−12−θ−32−θ−52)=32(√θ−1√θ5)+12(1√θ−1√θ3).

This, again, could be obtained more simply by multiplying the two factors first, and differentiating afterwards. This is not, however, always possible; see, for instance, here, example 8, in which the rule for differentiating a product must be used.

(8) Differentiate y=a1+a√x+a2x. dydx=(1+ax12+a2x)×0−ad(1+ax12+a2x)dx(1+a√x+a2x)2=−a(12ax−12+a2)(1+ax12+a2x)2.

(9) Differentiate y=x2x2+1. dydx=(x2+1)2x−x2×2x(x2+1)2=2x(x2+1)2.

(10) Differentiate y=a+√xa−√x.

In the indexed form, y=a+x12a−x12. dydx=(a−x12)(12x−12)−(a+x12)(−12x−12)(a−x12)2=a−x12+a+x122(a−x12)2x12;hencedydx=a(a−√x)2√x.

(11) Differentiate

θ=1−a3√t21+a2√t3.Nowθ=1−at231+at32.

dθdt=(1+at32)(−23at−13)−(1−at23)×32at12(1+at32)2=5a26√t7−4a3√t−9a2√t6(1+a2√t3)2.

(12) A reservoir of square cross-section has sides sloping at an angle of 45° with the vertical. The side of the bottom is 200 feet. Find an expression for the quantity pouring in or out when the depth of water varies by 1 foot; hence find, in gallons, the quantity withdrawn hourly when the depth is reduced from 14 to 10 feet in 24 hours.

The volume of a frustum of pyramid of height H, and of bases A and a, is V=H3(A+a+√Aa). It is easily seen that, the slope being 45°, if the depth be h, the length of the side of the square surface of the water is 200+2h feet, so that the volume of water is h3[2002+(200+2h)2+200(200+2h)]=40,000h+400h2+4h33.

dVdh=40,000+800h+4h2= cubic feet per foot of depth variation. The mean level from 14 to 10 feet is 12 feet, when h=12, dVdh=50,176 cubic feet.

Gallons per hour corresponding to a change of depth of 4 ft. in 24 hours =4×50,176×6.2524=52,267 gallons.

(13) The absolute pressure, in atmospheres, P, of saturated steam at the temperature t° C. is given by Dulong as being P=(40+t140)5 as long as t is above 80°. Find the rate of variation of the pressure with the temperature at 100° C.

Expand the numerator by the binomial theorem (see here). P=11405(405+5×404t+10×403t2+10×402t3+5×40t4+t5);

hencedPdt=1537,824×105(5×404+20×403t+30×402t2+20×40t3+5t4), when t=100 this becomes 0.036 atmosphere per degree Centigrade change of temperature.

Let us try the effect of repeating several times over the operation of differentiating a function (see here). Begin with a concrete case.

Let y=x5. First differentiation, 5x4.Second differentiation, 5×4x3=20x3.Third differentiation, 5×4×3x2=60x2.Fourth differentiation, 5×4×3×2x=120x.Fifth differentiation, 5×4×3×2×1=120.Sixth differentiation, =0.

There is a certain notation, with which we are already acquainted (see here), used by some writers, that is very convenient. This is to employ the general symbol f(x) for any function of x. Here the symbol f() is read as “function of,” without saying what particular function is meant. So the statement y=f(x) merely tells us that y is a function of x, it may be x2 or axn, or cosx or any other complicated function of x.

The corresponding symbol for the differential coefficient is f′(x), which is simpler to write than dydx. This is called the “derived function” of x.

Suppose we differentiate over again, we shall get the “second derived function” or second differential coefficient, which is denoted by ; and so on.

Now let us generalize.

Let .

But this is not the only way of indicating successive differentiations. For,  and this is more conveniently written as , or more usually . Similarly, we may write as the result of thrice differentiating, .

Some of the most important problems of the calculus are those where time is the independent variable, and we have to think about the values of some other quantity that varies when the time varies. Some things grow larger as time goes on; some other things grow smaller. The distance that a train has got from its starting place goes on ever increasing as time goes on. Trees grow taller as the years go by. Which is growing at the greater rate; a plant 12 inches high which in one month becomes 14 inches high, or a tree 12 feet high which in a year becomes 14 feet high?

In this chapter we are going to make much use of the word rate. Nothing to do with poor-rate, or water-rate (except that even here the word suggests a proportion–a ratio–so many pence in the pound). Nothing to do even with birth-rate or death-rate, though these words suggest so many births or deaths per thousand of the population. When a motor-car whizzes by us, we say: What a terrific rate! When a spendthrift is flinging about his money, we remark that that young man is living at a prodigious rate. What do we mean by rate? In both these cases we are making a mental comparison of something that is happening, and the length of time that it takes to happen. If the motor-car flies past us going 10 yards per second, a simple bit of mental arithmetic will show us that this is equivalent–while it lasts–to a rate of 600 yards per minute, or over 20 miles per hour.

Now in what sense is it true that a speed of 10 yards per second is the same as 600 yards per minute? Ten yards is not the same as 600 yards, nor is one second the same thing as one minute. What we mean by saying that the rate is the same, is this: that the proportion borne between distance passed over and time taken to pass over it, is the same in both cases.

Take another example. A man may have only a few pounds in his possession, and yet be able to spend money at the rate of millions a year–provided he goes on spending money at that rate for a few minutes only. Suppose you hand a shilling over the counter to pay for some goods; and suppose the operation lasts exactly one second. Then, during that brief operation, you are parting with your money at the rate of 1 shilling per second, which is the same rate as £3 per minute, or £180 per hour, or £4320 per day, or £1,576,800 per year! If you have £10 in your pocket, you can go on spending money at the rate of a million a year for just 514 minutes.

It is said that Sandy had not been in London above five minutes when “bang went saxpence.” If he were to spend money at that rate all day long, say for 12 hours, he would be spending 6 shillings an hour, or £3. 12s . per day, or £21. 12s . a week, not counting the Sawbbath.

Now try to put some of these ideas into differential notation.

Let y in this case stand for money, and let t stand for time.

If you are spending money, and the amount you spend in a short time dt be called dy, the rate of spending it will be dydt, or rather, should be written with a minus sign, as −dydt, because dy is a decrement, not an increment. But money is not a good example for the calculus, because it generally comes and goes by jumps, not by a continuous flow–you may earn £200 a year, but it does not keep running in all day long in a thin stream; it comes in only weekly, or monthly, or quarterly, in lumps: and your expenditure also goes out in sudden payments.

A more apt illustration of the idea of a rate is furnished by the speed of a moving body. From London (Euston station) to Liverpool is 200 miles. If a train leaves London at 7 o'clock, and reaches Liverpool at 11 o'clock, you know that, since it has travelled 200 miles in 4 hours, its average rate must have been 50 miles per hour; because 200=50. Here you are really making a mental comparison between the distance passed over and the time taken to pass over it. You are dividing one by the other. If y is the whole distance, and t the whole time, clearly the average rate is yt. Now the speed was not actually constant all the way: at starting, and during the slowing up at the end of the journey, the speed was less. Probably at some part, when running downhill, the speed was over 60 miles an hour. If, during any particular element of time dt, the corresponding element of distance passed over was dy, then at that part of the journey the speed was dydt. The rate at which one quantity (in the present instance, distance) is changing in relation to the other quantity (in this case, time) is properly expressed, then, by stating the differential coefficient of one with respect to the other. A velocity, scientifically expressed, is the rate at which a very small distance in any given direction is being passed over; and may therefore be written v=dydt.

But if the velocity v is not uniform, then it must be either increasing or else decreasing. The rate at which a velocity is increasing is called the acceleration. If a moving body is, at any particular instant, gaining an additional velocity dv in an element of time dt, then the acceleration a at that instant may be written a=dvdt; but dv is itself d(dydt). Hence we may put a=d(dydt)dt; and this is usually written a=d2ydt2; or the acceleration is the second differential coefficient of the distance, with respect to time. Acceleration is expressed as a change of velocity in unit time, for instance, as being so many feet per second per second; the notation used being feet÷second2.

When a railway train has just begun to move, its velocity v is small; but it is rapidly gaining speed–it is being hurried up, or accelerated, by the effort of the engine. So its d2ydt2 is large. When it has got up its top speed it is no longer being accelerated, so that then d2ydt2 has fallen to zero. But when it nears its stopping place its speed begins to slow down; may, indeed, slow down very quickly if the brakes are put on, and during this period of deceleration or slackening of pace, the value of dvdt, that is, of d2ydt2 will be negative.

To accelerate a mass m requires the continuous application of force. The force necessary to accelerate a mass is proportional to the mass, and it is also proportional to the acceleration which is being imparted. Hence we may write for the force f, the expression f=ma;orf=mdvdt;orf=md2ydt2.

The product of a mass by the speed at which it is going is called its momentum, and is in symbols mv. If we differentiate momentum with respect to time we shall get d(mv)dt for the rate of change of momentum. But, since m is a constant quantity, this may be written mdvdt, which we see above is the same as f. That is to say, force may be expressed either as mass times acceleration, or as rate of change of momentum.

Again, if a force is employed to move something (against an equal and opposite counter-force), it does work; and the amount of work done is measured by the product of the force into the distance (in its own direction) through which its point of application moves forward. So if a force f moves forward through a length y, the work done (which we may call w) will be w=f×y; where we take f as a constant force. If the force varies at different parts of the range y, then we must find an expression for its value from point to point. If f be the force along the small element of length dy, the amount of work done will be f×dy. But as dy is only an element of length, only an element of work will be done. If we write w for work, then an element of work will be dw; and we have dw=f×dy; which may be written dw=ma·dy; ordw=md2ydt2·dy;ordw=mdvdt·dy. Further, we may transpose the expression and write dwdy=f.

This gives us yet a third definition of force; that if it is being used to produce a displacement in any direction, the force (in that direction) is equal to the rate at which work is being done per unit of length in that direction. In this last sentence the word rate is clearly not used in its time-sense, but in its meaning as ratio or proportion.

Sir Isaac Newton, who was (along with Leibniz) an inventor of the methods of the calculus, regarded all quantities that were varying as flowing; and the ratio which we nowadays call the differential coefficient he regarded as the rate of flowing, or the fluxion of the quantity in question. He did not use the notation of the dy and dx, and dt (this was due to Leibnitz), but had instead a notation of his own. If y was a quantity that varied, or “flowed,” then his symbol for its rate of variation (or “fluxion”) was ˙y. If x was the variable, then its fluxion was called ˙x. The dot over the letter indicated that it had been differentiated. But this notation does not tell us what is the independent variable with respect to which the differentiation has been effected. When we see dydt we know that y is to be differentiated with respect to t. If we see dydx we know that y is to be differentiated with respect to x. But if we see merely ˙y, we cannot tell without looking at the context whether this is to mean dydx or dydt or dydz, or what is the other variable. So, therefore, this fluxional notation is less informing than the differential notation, and has in consequence largely dropped out of use. But its simplicity gives it an advantage if only we will agree to use it for those cases exclusively where time is the independent variable. In that case ˙y will mean dydt and ˙u will mean dudt; and ¨x will mean d2xdt2.

Adopting this fluxional notation we may write the mechanical equations considered in the paragraphs above, as follows:

Examples (1) A body moves so that the distance x (in feet), which it travels from a certain point O, is given by the relation x=0.2t2+10.4, where t is the time in seconds elapsed since a certain instant. Find the velocity and acceleration 5 seconds after the body began to move, and also find the corresponding values when the distance covered is 100 feet. Find also the average velocity during the first 10 seconds of its motion. (Suppose distances and motion to the right to be positive.) Now x=0.2t2+10.4v=˙x=dxdt=0.4t;anda=¨x=d2xdt2=0.4=constant.

When t=0, x=10.4 and v=0. The body started from a point 10.4 feet to the right of the point O; and the time was reckoned from the instant the body started.

When t=5, v=0.4×5=2ft./sec.; a=0.4ft./sec2.

When x=100, 100=0.2t2+10.4, or t2=448, and t=21.17sec.; v=0.4×21.17=8.468ft./sec.

When t=10, distance travelled=0.2×102+10.4−10.4=20ft.Average velocity=2010=2ft./sec.

(It is the same velocity as the velocity at the middle of the interval, t=5; for, the acceleration being constant, the velocity has varied uniformly from zero when t=0 to 4ft./sec. when t=10.)

(2) In the above problem let us suppose x=0.2t2+3t+10.4.v=˙x=dxdt=0.4t+3;a=¨x=d2xdt2=0.4=constant.

When t=0, x=10.4 and v=3 ft./sec, the time is reckoned from the instant at which the body passed a point 10.4 ft. from the point O, its velocity being then already 3 ft./sec. To find the time elapsed since it began moving, let v=0; then 0.4t+3=0, t=−3.4=−7.5 sec. The body began moving 7.5 sec. before time was begun to be observed; 5 seconds after this gives t=−2.5 and v=0.4×−2.5+3=2 ft./sec.

When x=100 ft., 100=0.2t2+3t+10.4;or t2+15t−448=0; hence t=14.95 sec., v=0.4×14.95+3=8.98 ft./sec.

To find the distance travelled during the 10 first seconds of the motion one must know how far the body was from the point O when it started.

When t=−7.5, x=0.2×(−7.5)2−3×7.5+10.4=−0.85ft., that is 0.85 ft. to the left of the point O.

Now, when t=2.5, x=0.2×2.52+3×2.5+10.4=19.15.

So, in 10 seconds, the distance travelled was 19.15+0.85=20 ft., and the average velocity =2010=2 ft./sec.

(3) Consider a similar problem when the distance is given by x=0.2t2−3t+10.4. Then v=0.4t−3, a=0.4=constant. When t=0, x=10.4 as before, and v=−3; so that the body was moving in the direction opposite to its motion in the previous cases. As the acceleration is positive, however, we see that this velocity will decrease as time goes on, until it becomes zero, when v=0 or 0.4t−3=0; or t=7.5 sec. After this, the velocity becomes positive; and 5 seconds after the body started, t=12.5, and v=0.4×12.5−3=2 ft./sec.

When x=100, 100=0.2t2−3t+10.4,or t2−15t−448=0,andt=29.95; v=0.4×29.95−3=8.98ft./sec.

When v is zero, x=0.2×7.52−3×7.5+10.4=−0.85, informing us that the body moves back to 0.85 ft. beyond the point O before it stops. Ten seconds later t=17.5 and x=0.2×17.52−3×17.5+10.4=19.15. The distance travelled=.85+19.15=20.0, and the average velocity is again 2 ft./sec.

(4) Consider yet another problem of the same sort with x=0.2t3−3t2+10.4; v=0.6t2−6t; a=1.2t−6. The acceleration is no more constant.

When t=0, x=10.4, v=0, a=−6. The body is at rest, but just ready to move with a negative acceleration, that is to gain a velocity towards the point O.

(5) If we have x=0.2t3−3t+10.4, then v=0.6t2−3, and a=1.2t.

When t=0, x=10.4; v=−3; a=0.

The body is moving towards the point O with a velocity of 3 ft./sec., and just at that instant the velocity is uniform.

We see that the conditions of the motion can always be at once ascertained from the time-distance equation and its first and second derived functions. In the last two cases the mean velocity during the first 10 seconds and the velocity 5 seconds after the start will no more be the same, because the velocity is not increasing uniformly, the acceleration being no longer constant.

(6) The angle θ (in radians) turned through by a wheel is given by θ=3+2t−0.1t3, where t is the time in seconds from a certain instant; find the angular velocity ω and the angular acceleration α, (a ) after 1 second; (b ) after it has performed one revolution. At what time is it at rest, and how many revolutions has it performed up to that instant?

Writing for the acceleration ω=˙θ=dθdt=2−0.3t2,α=¨θ=d2θdt2=−0.6t.

When t=0, θ=3; ω=2 rad./sec.; α=0.

When t=1, ω=2−0.3=1.7rad./sec.;α=−0.6rad./sec2.

This is a retardation; the wheel is slowing down.

After 1 revolution θ=2π=6.28;6.28=3+2t−0.1t3.

By plotting the graph, θ=3+2t−0.1t3, we can get the value or values of t for which θ=6.28; these are 2.11 and 3.03 (there is a third negative value).

When t=2.11, θ=6.28;ω=2−1.34=0.66 rad./sec.;α=−1.27 rad./sec2. When t=3.03, θ=6.28;ω=2−2.754=−0.754 rad./sec.;α=−1.82 rad./sec2.

The velocity is reversed. The wheel is evidently at rest between these two instants; it is at rest when ω=0, that is when 0=2−0.3t3, or when t=2.58sec., it has performed θ2π=3+2×2.58−0.1×2.5836.28=1.025 revolutions.

Sometimes one is stumped by finding that the expression to be differentiated is too complicated to tackle directly.

Thus, the equation y=(x2+a2)32 is awkward to a beginner.

Now the dodge to turn the difficulty is this: Write some symbol, such as u, for the expression x2+a2; then the equation becomes y=u3, which you can easily manage; for dydu=2u12. Then tackle the expression u=x2+a2, and differentiate it with respect to x, dudx=2x. Then all that remains is plain sailing; fordydx=dydu×dudx;that is,dydx=32u12×2x=32(x2+a2)12×2x=3x(x2+a2)12; and so the trick is done.

By and by, when you have learned how to deal with sines, and cosines, and exponentials, you will find this dodge of increasing usefulness.

Examples Let us practise this dodge on a few examples.

(1) Differentiate y=√a+x.

Let a+x=u. dudx=1;y=u12;dydu=12u−12=12(a+x)−12.dydx=dydu×dudx=12√a+x.

(2) Differentiate y=1√a+x2.

Let a+x2=u. dudx=2x;y=u−12;dydu=−12u−32.dydx=dydu×dudx=−x√(a+x2)3.

(3) Differentiate y=(m−nx23+px43)a.

Let m−nx2+px−43=u. dudx=−23nx−13−43px−73;y=ua;dydu=aua−1.dydx=dydu×dudx=−a(m−nx23+p)a−1(23nx−13+43px−73).

(4) Differentiate y=1√x3−a2.

Let u=x3−a2. dudx=3x2;y=u−12;dydu=−12(x3−a2)−32.dydx=dydu×dudx=−3x22√(x3−a2)3.

(5) Differentiate y=√1−x1+x.

Write this as y=(1−x)12(1+x)12. dydx=(1+x)12d(1−x)12dx−(1−x)12d(1+x)12dx1+x.

(We may also write y=(1−x)1(1+x)−12 and differentiate as a product.)

Proceeding as in example (1) above, we get d(1−x)12dx=−1;andd(1+x)12dx=12√1+x.

Hence dydx=−(1+x)122(1+x)√1−x−(1−x)122(1+x)√1+x=−12√1+x√1−x−√1−x2√(1+x)3;ordydx=−1(1+x)√1−x2.

(6) Differentiate y=√x31+x2.

We may write this y=x32(1+x2)−12;dydx=32x12(1+x2)−12+x32×d[(1+x2)−12]dx.

Differentiating (1+x2)−12, as shown in example (2) above, we get d[(1+x2)−12]dx=−x√(1+x2)3; so that dydx=3√x2√1+x2−√x5√(1+x2)3=√x(3+x2)2√(1+x2)3.

(7) Differentiate y=(x+√x2+x+a)3.

Let x+√x2+x+a=u. dudx=1+d[(x2+x+a)12]dx.y=u3;anddydu=3u2=3(x+√x2+x+a)2.

Now let (x2+x+a)12=v and (x2+x+a)=w. dwdx=2x+1;v=w12;dvdw=12w−12.dvdx=dvdw×dwdx=12(x2+x+a)−12(2x+1).Hencedudx=1+2x+12√x2+x+a,dydx=dydu×dudx=3(x+√x2+x+a)2(1+2x+12√x2+x+a).

(8) Differentiate y=√a2+x2a2−x23√a2−x2a2+x2.

We get y=(a2+x2)12(a2−x2)13(a2−x2)12(a2+x2)13=(a2+x2)16(a2−x2)−16.dydx=(a2+x2)16d[(a2−x2)−16]dx+d[(a2+x2)16](a2−x2)16dx.

Let u=(a2−x2)−16 and v=(a2−x2). u=v−16;dudv=−16v−76;dvdx=−2x.dudx=dudv×dvdx=13x(a2−x2)−76.

Let w=(a2+x2)16 and z=(a2+x2). w=z16;dwdz=16z−56;dzdx=2x.dwdx=dwdz×dzdx=13x(a2+x2)−56.

Hence dydx=(a2+x2)16x3(a2−x2)76+x3(a2−x2)16(a2+x2)56;ordydx=x3[6√a2+x2(a2−x2)7+16√(a2−x2)(a2+x2)5]].

(9) Differentiate yn with respect to y5. d(yn)d(y5)=nyn−15y5−1=n5yn−5.

(10) Find the first and second differential coefficients of y=xb√(a−x)x. dydx=xbd{[(a−x)x]12}dx+√(a−x)xb.

Let [(a−x)x]12=u and let (a−x)x=w; then u=w12. dudw=12w−12=12w12=12√(a−x)x. dwdx=a−2x.dudw×dwdx=dudx=a−2x2√(a−x)x.

Hence dydx=x(a−2x)2b√(a−x)x+√(a−x)xb=x(3a−4x)2b√(a−x)x.

Now d2ydx2=2b√(a−x)x(3a−8x)−(3ax−4x2)b(a−2x)√(a−x)x4b2(a−x)x=3a2−12ax+8x24b(a−x)√(a−x)x.

(We shall need these two last differential coefficients later on. See Chapter XII, Exercise 11)

(7) 2a(x−a)(x+a)3.
(8) 52y3.
(9) 1(1−θ)√1−θ2. 
The process can be extended to three or more differential coefficients, so that dydx=dydz×dzdv×dvdx.
Examples (1) If z=3x4; v=7z2; y=√1+v, find dvdx.
We have dydv=12√1+v;dvdz=−14z3;dzdx=12x3.dydx=−168x3(2√1+v)z3=−283x5√9x8+7.
(2) If t=15√θ; x=t3+t2; v=7x23√x−1, find dvdθ. dvdx=7x(5x−6)33√(x−1)4;dxdt=3t2+12;dtdθ=−110√θ3.Hencedvdθ=−7x(5x−6)(3t2+12)303√(x−1)4√θ3, an expression in which x must be replaced by its value, and t by its value in terms of θ.
(3) If θ=3a2x√x3; ω=√1−θ21+θ; and ϕ=√3−1ω√2, find dϕdx.

We get θ=3a2x−12;ω=√1−θ1+θ;andϕ=√3−1√2ω−1.dθdx=−3a22√x3;dωdθ=−1(1+θ)√1−θ2 (see example 5, here); and dϕdω=1.

So that dθdx=1√2×ω2×1(1+θ)√1−θ2×3a22√x3.

Replace now first ω, then θ by its value.
