## AI Summary (from Notion)
- Release Version: 0.14.0 of deptry was created on March 16, 2024.
- Main Improvement: Speed enhancement for large projects through the use of Rust for parsing Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and extracting import statements.
- User Impact: Little change in user experience aside from improved execution speed.
- Notable Changes:
- Enhanced identification of column identifiers in import detection (now points to the correct column).
- More verbose error messages when files cannot be read, including source file and line number.
- Wheels on PyPi: Introduction of multiple .whl files for various platforms and architectures:
- Linux: ABI3 wheels for x86_64 and aarch64.
- Windows: ABI3 wheels for x64.
- macOS: ABI3 wheels for x86_64 and aarch64.
- Source Distribution: A source distribution (sdist) package is also provided.
- Full Changelog: Available for comparison between versions 0.13.0 and 0.14.0.

## What's Changed

This release significantly improves the speed of deptry, particularly for large projects, by utilizing Rust to manage the parsing of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) from .py files and to extract the import statements. For some benchmarks, see below:

### Changes

Since the changes are all in the back-end, little has changed for the user other than the execution speed. The two minor notable changes are:

- Improved identification of column identifier in imports detection. Where earlier the column identifier for an imported module foo in the line import foo would be 0, it now points to column 8.
- When a file can not be read, the error will be slightly more verbose and include the source file and line pointing to the location in deptry's source code responsible for logging the warning. So instead of Warning: File file1.py could not be read. Skipping..., the error will now read WARNING deptry.imports:imports.rs:66 Warning: File file1.py could not be read. Skipping.... This will likely be reverted in the future.
### Available wheels on PyPi

Where earlier releases published a single .whl file to PyPi, with the move to Rust we now build and publish wheels for a variety of platforms and architectures. More specifically, wheel files for the following combinations are now available on PyPi:

- Linux: ABI3 wheels for x86_64 and aarch64 architectures.
- Windows: ABI3 wheels for the x64 architecture.
- macOS: ABI3 wheels for x86_64 and aarch64 (Apple Silicon) architectures.
Alongside the ABI3 wheels, we provide a source distribution (sdist) package.
