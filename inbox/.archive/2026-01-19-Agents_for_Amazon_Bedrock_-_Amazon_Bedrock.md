## Amazon Bedrock pricing

When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Amazon Bedrock. However, you are charged only for the services that you use.

To see your bill, go to the Billing and Cost Management Dashboard in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. To learn more about AWS account billing, see the AWS Billing User Guide. If you have questions concerning AWS billing and AWS accounts, contact AWS Support.

With Amazon Bedrock, you pay to run inference on any of the third-party foundation models. Pricing is based on the volume of input tokens and output tokens, and on whether you have purchased provisioned throughput for the model. For more information, see the Model providers page in the Amazon Bedrock console. For each model, pricing is listed following the model version. For more information about purchasing Provisioned Throughput, see Provisioned Throughput.
