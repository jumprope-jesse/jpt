NAISYS provides a thin layer between LLM(s) and the command shell. It provides the scaffolding for autonomous operation and commands for inter-agent communication.

Here is a sample website that was built with NAISYS by an AI dev and admin agent. Here are the logs of the process, and a video of it being built in real time.

```plain text
npm install -g naisys
```

Use the above install command on Linux or Windows/WSL to start building your own mutli-agent command line automations. See the NPM page for how to configure.

NAISYS is a MIT licensed open source project. We'd love to hear your results and feedback on what models give you good results. We're also interested in ideas of how to fine tune models for better console interactions. Come say 👋 in the Discord!
