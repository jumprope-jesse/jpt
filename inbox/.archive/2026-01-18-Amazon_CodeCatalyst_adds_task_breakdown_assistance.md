Today, we're excited to announce the availability of a new capability of Amazon Q to analyze issues for complexity and propose splitting the work into separate tasks.

Now when customers assign an issue to Amazon Q, the analysis of the issue includes a summarization of the issue's complexity. If it's a complex issue, Amazon Q suggests a list of tasks that breaks down the work into more manageable portions. These tasks can be individually assigned to any user in the project or assigned to Amazon Q.

This new capability of Amazon Q in CodeCatalyst is currently available for projects and spaces in the US West (Oregon) AWS Region. To learn more, visit the Amazon CodeCatalyst webpage, or see the Amazon CodeCatalyst documentation.
