# Bird Buddy’s new Petal backyard nature cameras attract and document more than just birds | The Verge

## Overview (from Notion)
- Engagement with Nature: As a father, the Petal camera and Wonder Blocks can be a fun way to engage your children with nature, encouraging them to explore and learn about local wildlife and plants.

- Tech and Education: The integration of AI and technology in documenting nature could serve as an educational tool to teach kids about biology, ecology, and the environment.

- Urban Living: Living in NYC, you might find it challenging to connect with nature. These tools could help create a mini-ecosystem in your backyard or balcony, bringing nature closer to home.

- Sustainability: The focus on attracting pollinators and supporting local ecosystems aligns with growing trends in sustainability and environmental responsibility, which might resonate with your values.

- Alternative Perspectives:
- Skepticism About Tech: Some might argue that relying on technology to appreciate nature could detract from genuine experiences and observations.
- Cost vs. Value: The investment in these products could be seen as excessive, especially if one questions the necessity of advanced tech for simple nature observation.

The Petal camera offers over a month of battery life that can be extended nearly indefinitely using a solar panel.

Bird Buddy’s camera-equipped smart feeders helped make bird-watching more accessible and easier by autonomously documenting all the wildlife that stopped by to eat. The company’s new Petal camera is designed to do the same for plants and insects, while its reconfigurable Wonder Blocks will help attract more nature to your yard. They were first announced at CES 2025, but are finally available for preorder.

The company has once again opted for a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign to bring its new products to consumers, with delivery expected sometime in mid-2026. The 12-megapixel Petal camera, which captures videos at 4K and uses a “proprietary AI model trained to recognize over 2,000 species of birds, bees, butterflies, insects, and native plants in real time,” will be available on its own for $129. It will also be sold in a discounted $249 Duo Petal Pack, which includes two cameras and a pole to mount them to.

Using a bendable grip the Petal can attach to various supports including a tree branch or other sturdy plants.

Using “low-powered architecture,” the Petal camera can operate autonomously for over a month on a single charge, but it also comes with a solar panel that can potentially extend battery life indefinitely if it gets enough exposure to the sun every day. Its lenses are swappable, letting you choose between a wide-angle view of your garden, or a close-up macro shot to capture detailed video and images of insects.

All the footage it captures throughout the day is accessible through a mobile app, or you can watch what’s going on live. If you prefer just a highlight reel, the Petal Camera has a Nature’s Voice feature that pulls together “BBC Earth–style mini documentaries” that include AI-generated narration based on what insects and plants the camera identifies.

The Wonder Blocks modular smart habitat system can be upgraded with planters, feeders, and housing to attract insects.

The Wonder Blocks are described as a “modular smart habitat system designed to support pollinators like bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds in your outdoor space” using components that offer water, food, and shelter. At its core is a smart planter called the Habitat, priced at $149, that serves as a base pedestal for upgrades like a bee habitat or a small constantly flowing stream.

For $299, the larger Wonder Blocks set adds a single Petal camera and an Observation Pole, while a $499 Wonder Blocks Hero set includes two cameras, an arched frame to which magnetic accessories can be mounted, and three attachments for feeding hummingbirds and sheltering butterflies.

The Wonder Blocks system will work with a dedicated Wonder App that is currently under development and will be separate to the app that works with the company’s smart feeders. However, Bird Buddy says “Petal and Wonder Blocks are designed as part of a broader nature tech ecosystem,” and it plans to eventually share more details about integrations between the two product lines in the future.
