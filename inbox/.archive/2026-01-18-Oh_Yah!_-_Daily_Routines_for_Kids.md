## How Oh Yah! Helps

Each task has a dedicated timer in a distraction-free environment. Navigation is disabled during focus time to maintain attention and encourage task completion.

Kids can submit photo evidence of completed tasks, building accountability whilst giving parents peace of mind about task completion.

Ordered tasks provide structure and sequence, whilst unordered tasks offer flexibility. Clear priorities help kids understand what needs to be done when.

Parents review individual tasks but award stars for the complete schedule. Auto-approval with full stars occurs after 24 hours if all tasks are submitted and no manual award is given.

Manage up to 8 child profiles with individual schedules and tasks. Perfect for families with multiple children.

Clean interface with simple navigation. Kids tap their profile and start immediately - no complex menus or overwhelming choices.

Oh Yah! is for families who need routine management that works with their child's unique needs — not generic productivity apps that overwhelm.

### You should try Oh Yah! if:

- Your child struggles with daily routines and needs constant reminders
- Mornings and after-school time are stressful battles
- You've tried reward charts and systems that didn't stick
- Your child needs clear structure but gets overwhelmed easily
