# Introduction to AI Fluency

## Overview (from Notion)
- The AI Fluency course emphasizes the importance of understanding AI collaboration, which could enhance your software development and business strategies.
- The 4D Framework (Delegation, Description, Discernment, Diligence) can streamline your interactions with AI tools, making your workflow more efficient and innovative.
- Engaging with AI in a responsible way aligns with your role as a company founder, ensuring that your products contribute positively to society.
- The collaboration between educators and AI developers highlights the value of interdisciplinary approaches, which you can apply in your own projects to foster creativity and innovation.
- Consider the ethical implications of AI in your work—how can you ensure your software is both effective and responsible?
- Alternate views might include skepticism about AI's ability to enhance creativity or concerns over its impact on jobs; weigh these against the potential for AI to empower your team and improve productivity.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
The AI Fluency course, developed in collaboration with educators, aims to empower individuals to engage effectively and responsibly with AI. It introduces the 4D Framework (Delegation, Description, Discernment, Diligence) for human-AI collaboration, emphasizing practical applications across various contexts. The course is designed to enhance understanding of generative AI systems and promote strategic interaction with AI tools, supported by extensive collaboration and validation from human authors alongside AI assistance.

## Content (from Notion)

At Anthropic, we believe that empowering people with AI, and ensuring that AI makes safe contributions to society, requires engaging with a wide range of human perspectives and experiences. Responsible AI development and engagement isn't something any single discipline or viewpoint can fully address. It demands collaborative approaches that span a wide range of technical, creative, business, scientific, and educational domains. That's why we partnered with educators who bring complementary expertise to create this foundational course on AI collaboration.

This course is the result of a long partnership between Anthropic and professors Rick Dakan from Ringling College of Art and Design and Joseph Feller from University College Cork. Rick and Joe developed the AI Fluency Framework in 2023-2024, based on their research exploring how AI tools like Claude were transforming creative and business processes. When we saw the framework, we immediately recognized a shared vision: helping people interact with AI effectively and responsibly, beyond just “cool prompts.” Their framework offered exactly the kind of multidisciplinary perspective we believe is essential for navigating AI’s impact on society.

The AI Fluency Framework they created — four interconnected competencies (Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence) — enables more effective, efficient, ethical, and safe human-AI collaboration, regardless of which new AI models or tools emerge. We collaborated to develop this course based on their framework, bringing together our collective expertise in AI systems, education, creativity, and business innovation. The work was supported in part by the Higher Education Authority (Ireland) through the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning.

This framework has already informed undergraduate and postgraduate courses at both Ringling College and University College Cork, as well as staff training initiatives and community outreach events. Now, we’re excited to share these insights more broadly through this open online course.

Our goal is to make AI Fluency accessible and useful to everyone, no matter what stage of AI expertise you find yourself at. We hope you find it valuable in navigating the evolving landscape of AI collaboration.

Establish foundational understanding of generative AI systems and why developing AI fluency matters for effective collaboration. Introduces the 4D Framework as a structured approach to human-AI interaction, covering core capabilities and limitations of current AI technologies. Provides the conceptual grounding needed to approach AI tools strategically rather than reactively.

In the development of the AI Fluency: Framework and Foundations course, we engaged in extensive collaboration with Claude 3.7 from Anthropic.

The base content for this course came from:

- The AI Fluency Framework Practical Summary Document by Rick Dakan (at Ringling College of Art and Design) and Joseph Feller (at University College Cork) and related working documents and research notes
- Slide decks and lecture transcripts from multiple university courses, guest lectures, and research talks delivered by Feller and/or Dakan
- Technical/practical content provided by Maggie Vo and Drew Bent (Anthropic)
Throughout this process, Claude assisted one or more of the human authors with structural development, resource and exercise design, and content drafting, critiquing, editing and rewriting. The human authors wrote, designed, edited and provided continual vision, expertise, critical judgment, and domain knowledge and made all final decisions about both content and approach.

All AI-generated and co-created content underwent thorough validation, editing, and curation by the human authors. The final materials accurately reflect the human authors' understanding, expertise, and intended pedagogical approach. While AI assistance was instrumental in producing these materials, the human authors maintain responsibility for the content.

This disclosure is made in the spirit of transparency advocated by the AI Fluency Framework and to acknowledge the evolving role of AI in educational content development and other creative and intellectual work.
