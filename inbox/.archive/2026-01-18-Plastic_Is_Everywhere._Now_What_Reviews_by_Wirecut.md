# Plastic Is Everywhere. Now What? | Reviews by Wirecutter

## Overview (from Notion)
- Relevance to Daily Life: As a father, you may be concerned about the impact of plastics on your family's health and the environment, prompting you to seek sustainable practices.
- Environmental Awareness: The article emphasizes the need for systemic change and individual actions, aligning with the increasing awareness of environmental issues in urban settings like NYC.
- Actionable Tips: Simple steps like washing clothes in cold water can reduce microplastic shedding, making it practical for busy parents looking to make small changes.
- Unique Viewpoints: The article highlights the connection between consumer habits and environmental impact, encouraging readers to prioritize durability and intentionality in purchases.
- Alternate Views: Some may argue that individual actions are insufficient without larger policy changes, emphasizing the need for collective action and corporate responsibility in addressing plastic pollution.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Addressing plastic pollution requires systemic change and individual actions. Start by reducing plastic exposure through mindful shopping, washing clothes in cold water, and minimizing laundry frequency to lower microplastic shedding. Small changes can significantly impact the environment.

Katie Okamoto is an editor focusing on sustainability. She’s covered the intersections of products, environment, and health for more than a decade.

In the first edition of our three-part plastics challenge, our sustainability editor breaks down what the science says (so far) about the plastic in our environments and how to start making thoughtful decisions about your consumption. Plus: one tip you can do today to reduce microplastic shedding.

The headlines are full of plastic these days. From black plastic kitchen utensils to microplastics, it’s all a bit alarming. Maybe you’re looking around your home, clocking all the plastic, and wondering what to do. Overwhelming? Of course. Hopeless? Not necessarily.

“Systemic change across the entire life cycle of plastics is required to eliminate plastic pollution,” Kate Whitman, a research fellow at the Revolution Plastics Institute at the University of Portsmouth, told me over email. “But individuals can also take steps to reduce both their own contribution to plastic pollution and their own exposure to microplastics.”

Over the next three weeks, we’ll walk you through some of those expert-backed steps you can personally take (the first of which is down below!). To decide what to do as individuals — and know what we can and can’t control — it helps to first understand the systemic scale of the global plastic problem and how we fit into it.

## What’s the problem?

In recent years, the conversation around plastics has shifted to the less obvious plastics swimming through our environment: microplastics and nanoplastics. Pervasive and seemingly everywhere, microplastics are plastic bits that are less than 5 millimeters long (smaller than the width of a #2 pencil), while nanoplastics are even smaller and invisible to the eye. These tiny plastic bits are shed from larger pieces or threads of plastic, or they may be made small to begin with (like plastic microbeads).

Microplastics and nanoplastics originate from a range of sources, from the synthetic clothes we wear to car tires to paints to plastic packaging. And because plastic contains a range of chemicals that are added to improve performance, flexibility, and durability, scientists are concerned that plastic bits may also leach potentially harmful chemicals, including bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, and PFAS.

Scientists have been developing the ability to detect and measure micro- and nanoplastic in more and more places — from snow-capped mountains to the deep sea, as well as in our food, our drinking water, and our bodies. Brains, blood, beer, broccoli — you name it. Look, and you probably shall find. We’re still learning what impacts all this plastic has on ecosystems and our own health, but some experts say there is cause for concern.

If all this sounds like a lot, let me share my best distilled advice, the North Star that’s remained true through all my reporting: Try to shop slowly and buy less. Most of the time, when you prioritize durability, repairability, and intentionality in your purchases, you’ll accomplish three goals: You’ll start to shrink your plastic footprint, you’ll start to lower your plastic exposure, and you’ll start to reduce your carbon footprint, too.

More on all of that in the coming weeks. See you then.

## One small change you can make today: Cool your laundry

Michael Hession/NYT Wirecutter

Polyester, nylon, and other synthetic fibers shed off our clothes all the time, but research has shown that laundry is a significant source of microplastics to wastewater, and those microfibers can end up in natural waterways, with possible impacts on aquatic life. Research also suggests that tumble dryers may release significant amounts of microplastics into the air.

These laundry tips may help reduce microplastic shedding into your air and wastewater. And they’ll certainly help you use less energy, save money, and prolong the life of your clothing.

- Go cold. “The majority of energy used by a washing machine occurs during hot water cycles,” writes Andrea Barnes, Wirecutter’s senior staff writer who covers all things laundry. “Washing clothes in cold water saves energy and is ultimately one of the most environmentally impactful things you can do in the laundry room.” Use a detergent (like one of these) that performs well with cold water washes.
- Line dry when possible. While research is ongoing, this 2022 study suggests that dryer cycles may be a significant source of airborne microplastics. If you wash mixed loads, pull out light weight items and delicates for line drying. Splitting your dryer load can also be less taxing to your clothes over time.
- Wash less often. Some things do need regular laundering, but others, like jeans, you can get away with washing far less frequently.
