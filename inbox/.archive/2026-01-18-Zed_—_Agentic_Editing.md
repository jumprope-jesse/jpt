# Zed — Agentic Editing

## Overview (from Notion)
- Enhanced Collaboration: The use of natively multiplayer IDEs like Zed allows for real-time collaboration with others, making it easier to work with teams or mentor junior developers.

- Efficiency in Coding: The Agentic editing feature can help streamline your coding process, allowing you to focus on larger problems while the assistant handles repetitive tasks.

- Learning and Growth: Engaging with advanced tools can keep you up-to-date with the latest trends and tech in software development, enhancing both personal and professional growth.

- Work-Life Balance: Tools that enhance productivity may free up more time for family, allowing you to spend quality moments without sacrificing work commitments.

- Community Insights: Feedback from early adopters highlights a collaborative and supportive community, providing opportunities for networking and sharing experiences.

- Flexibility in Development: The system's ability to adapt to various coding standards and environments can be beneficial for managing diverse projects, especially if you’re working across different teams or products.

- Alternative Perspectives: Some might argue that reliance on AI tools could lead to diminished problem-solving skills or creativity among developers. Balancing tool use with traditional coding practices could be key.

- Future of Work: Embracing these evolving tools may position you as a forward-thinking leader in your field, ready to adapt to the future of software development and team dynamics.

Words from early adopters

## Fast, Unobtrusive, and Effective

> I came from vim, and Zed is the Rust-powered code editor I’ve been waiting for. I love to dictate prompts to various LLMs and get notified when their work is ready to review. I got so much better at code review!

Amos Wenger

> By integrating editor capabilities into their agents, Zed agents delivered complete features while also preserving my project's coding standards – and as everything else the Zed team does, it was incredibly fast at it

José Valim

> Zed's Vim mode is the best I’ve used so far and when the Agent was launched, I had to try it. It perfectly fits Zed's philosophy of doing the best in the simplest form. It's not shouting at me, but is there when I need it. It does its job and stays standby until the next time.

Faith Arslan

> It's better than anything else I've tried — the context building is smart and well-designed. I'm impressed.

Nicolas Gere-lamaysouette

> Using Agentic editing with Zed and Amazon Bedrock means I can tackle any problem, in any language, fearlessly.

Shardul Vaidya

WW PSA GenAI for DevEx

> I've mostly been using the Agent to learn mobile app development, which isn't something I've done before. Having it able to work alongside me and correct my mistakes has been invaluable in getting me up to speed quickly!
