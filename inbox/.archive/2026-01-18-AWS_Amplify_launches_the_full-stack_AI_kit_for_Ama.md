Today, AWS announces the general availability of the AWS Amplify AI kit for Amazon Bedrock, the quickest way for fullstack developers to build web apps with AI capabilities such as chat, conversational search, and summarization. The Amplify AI kit allows developers to easily leverage their data to get customized responses from Amazon Bedrock AI models. The Amplify AI kit allows anyone with knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript, and web frameworks like React or Next.js, to add AI experiences to their apps, without any prior machine learning expertise.

The AI kit offers the following capabilities:

- A pre-built, fully customizable <AIConversation> React UI component that offers a real-time, streaming chat experience along with features like UI responses instead of plain-text, chat history, and resumable conversations.
- A type-safe client that provides secure server-side access to Amazon Bedrock.
- Secure, built-in capabilities to share user context (e.g. data the user can access) with Amazon Bedrock models.
- Define tools with additional context that can be invoked by the models.
- A fullstack TypeScript developer experience layered on Amplify Gen 2 and AWS AppSync.
