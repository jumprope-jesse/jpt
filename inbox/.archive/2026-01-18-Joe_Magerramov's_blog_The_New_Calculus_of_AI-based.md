# Joe Magerramov's blog: The New Calculus of AI-based Coding

## Overview (from Notion)
- Embrace AI collaboration: Leverage AI agents like Amazon Q to enhance coding efficiency while maintaining oversight, balancing family and work life.
- Agentic coding can lead to significant productivity gains, allowing you to focus more on strategic decisions and less on routine coding tasks.
- The need for rapid testing and deployment aligns with the fast-paced nature of life in NYC, where agility is key.
- Consider the communication bottlenecks: face-to-face discussions can streamline decision-making, which could inspire better team dynamics in your company.
- Explore the potential of integrating new testing methodologies to catch bugs early, reducing stress and improving product quality.
- Acknowledge the challenges of scaling with AI: fast coding speeds might introduce new complexities that require careful management.
- Reflect on alternative viewpoints, such as skepticism towards AI's reliability in coding—balance technology with human intuition and experience.
- Stay adaptable: as the software landscape evolves, so must your strategies, ensuring you remain competitive while fostering a healthy work-life balance.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
A team is leveraging AI agents for coding, achieving a tenfold increase in throughput while emphasizing the importance of human oversight and collaboration. To mitigate the risks of increased bug rates, they advocate for improved testing methods and faster feedback loops in CI/CD pipelines. Effective communication and coordination are crucial, especially at high velocities, and the integration of AI should enhance existing practices rather than complicate them. The potential of agentic development lies in making previously impractical engineering practices feasible.
