A child crouching down near a large raised garden bed filled with plants.

Any serious gardener will spend countless hours planning and planting, weeding and watering, cursing groundhogs, and drowning slugs in beer. If you’re up for all of that, a raised-garden-bed kit will certainly make it easier to get started.

A raised bed offers a lot of advantages: It can prevent soil compaction, drain reliably, and extend the growing season. And you can avoid planting in contaminated soil. Also, orderly, organized beds tend to look tidier than an in-ground garden.

To compare the best raised garden beds for sale, I spent 45 hours researching models, talking to gardeners, and comparing materials costs at landscape suppliers and lumber yards. And since I’m the chair of the PTA greening committee at my kids’ elementary school, I got permission to assemble six ready-made raised-bed kits on school grounds, as well as a DIY raised bed made out of notched concrete blocks and 2-by-6 cedar boards. Parents and students helped us fill the beds with 7 cubic yards of compost, soil, and seedlings — approximately 4.5 tons’ worth. We found a lot of good options.

With sturdy hardware and rot-resistant cedar, this bed can be assembled using only a drill and a rubber mallet. It’s got a high price tag, but it’s fair considering the quality of materials, and it ought to last a decade.

Made with cedar and stylish yet rugged hardware, this bed offers accessibility, if you can’t comfortably kneel or bend over. But its shallow, 10-inch soil depth limits your planting options.

Made with a food-safe alloy, this bed resists rust and corrosion for a decade-plus, according to its manufacturer. It’s simple to assemble and looks modern, but it feels less polished than Vego Garden’s bed.

For a specific size of bed, drop some cedar 2-by-6-foot lumber into these notched concrete blocks. This is a versatile DIY option, but if you use materials that are comparable to those in a good kit, you won’t save much money.

With sturdy hardware and rot-resistant cedar, this bed can be assembled using only a drill and a rubber mallet. It’s got a high price tag, but it’s fair considering the quality of materials, and it ought to last a decade.

Gardener’s Supply Company’s Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed won me over with its straightforward assembly, elegant look, rot-resistant cedar lumber, and powder-coated aluminum corner brackets. It measures 4 by 8 feet, and it’s nearly 15 inches deep, so it can accommodate many plants. But, contrary to its name, it’s not particularly well suited for deep-rooted vegetables, like zucchini or rhubarb, which prefer planting depths of at least 18 inches.

This bed took less than an hour to assemble, requiring only a drill and a rubber mallet. When it was filled with hundreds of pounds of compost and soil, the hardware didn’t budge, and the boards didn’t buckle. The smooth cedar boards should last about 10 to 15 years, aging into an elegant silvery-gray. This is a great-looking bed, and while the price is on the high side, it’s fair considering the quality of materials, compared with those of the competition (including a DIY option).

If you’re interested in an elevated raised garden bed, the Gardener’s Supply Company Elevated Cedar Planter Box is a beautiful and solidly constructed option. Its smooth, consistently sawed cedar boards and powder-coated aluminum legs and hardware give it a polished look that would certainly mesh with most outdoor spaces. Elevated raised beds provide easy accessibility for those who can’t comfortably bend over or kneel, and because these beds are up off the ground, drainage is also improved. You’ll need to line the bottom to keep the soil from sifting out. And the soil depth is only 10 inches, so you’re limited to shallow-rooted plants, like lettuce, radishes, and herbs.

If longevity is what you’re after, you can’t do much better than a modern metal raised garden bed. The Vego Garden 17" Tall 10 In 1 Jumbo Modular Metal Raised Garden Bed Kit is made with stainless steel hardware and corrosion-resistant alloy panels, and when these materials are combined, the resulting beds are virtually indestructible. This garden bed packs up neatly into a compact box, and (with the help of a cordless drill), it was assembled in about 45 minutes.

Vego Gardens offers this bed in a range of dimensions, including four different heights. All of these metal beds are modular in design, so they can be put together in a number of different configurations. I appreciated this bed’s refined details, including cap nuts that protect hands from sharp bolt tips. But, as is the case with other metal beds, our soil warmed more in this bed than in wooden beds.

Made with a food-safe alloy, this bed resists rust and corrosion for a decade-plus, according to its manufacturer. It’s simple to assemble and looks modern, but it feels less polished than Vego Garden’s bed.

Birdies has been making corrugated metal raised garden beds since 2009, and the Birdies Large Modular Metal Raised Garden Bed Kit is sturdy, attractive, and highly functional. Like the other metal bed I tested, this bed uses galvanized steel that’s been hot-dipped in aluminum, zinc, and magnesium, for maximum corrosion-resistance and general durability.

Simple instructions with helpful images made this bed easy to put together. And retailer Epic Gardening’s FAQ printout includes tips on placing the bed, filling it with soil, and gently repairing any dings or bent corners the panels may have acquired during shipping. This bed has five different configurations and two heights, the taller of which allows for comfortable, no-bend gardening (but requires lots of soil). We’d have preferred an option that was slightly taller than this 15-inch version. This one has limitations on plant-root depth, similar to the Gardener’s Supply Deep Root Cedar bed. And it’s shorter than the 29-inch version, which is simply too tall for most people.

For a specific size of bed, drop some cedar 2-by-6-foot lumber into these notched concrete blocks. This is a versatile DIY option, but if you use materials that are comparable to those in a good kit, you won’t save much money.

If you want to make custom-size beds to fit your space, you could build your own raised beds. But an easier DIY option would be to pop cedar lumber into sets of Oldcastle Planter Wall Blocks. You determine your dimensions, calculate how much lumber you need, and price it out. One thing to anticipate, though, is that there’s minimal cost savings if you’re using materials comparable to those in a good kit. To match the quality level of the preassembled kits, I used 2-by-6 finished cedar boards. These came in at $6.79 per linear foot, so a 4-by-8-foot bed with a 12-inch depth came to a total of almost $390 — more than the price of our top pick. The lumber isn’t fixed to the blocks, so it’s helpful if you choose a level site and thread rebar through holes in the blocks to reinforce the connections.

- I’ve grown vegetables, herbs, fruits, and native plants (with my grandmother’s pruners) at my home in Portland, Maine, since 2015. After 10 years of annual soil amendment, establishing (and reestablishing) borders and paths, and fighting a losing battle against weeds in my in-ground gardens, I was eager to learn why so many home gardeners love raised beds.
- To research this guide, I spent dozens of hours reading Reddit threads and watching videos that debate the merits of metal versus wooden raised beds. I also researched several gardening books, to get information about soil-depth requirements and growing seasons.
- To better understand the benefits of raised beds over in-ground gardens, I spoke with Caleb Goossen, organic crop and conservation specialist at Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association. I also learned about different lumber options and their varying prices and durability from Mike Friedland of Lumbery, a locally owned lumberyard in Cape Elizabeth, Maine.
- I made a mockup design of a DIY raised bed. And then I priced all of the necessary lumber and hardware, in order to assess any possible cost savings that raised-bed kits might offer.
- Like all Wirecutter journalists, I review and test products with complete editorial independence. I’m never made aware of any business implications of my editorial recommendations. Read more about our editorial standards.
Raised beds are an efficient way to use space in a small yard, since they can be planted relatively densely and eliminate the need for walkways. And because you (or your kids) aren’t likely to accidentally step into the beds, they help prevent soil compaction. They also warm up quickly in the spring and cool down slowly in the fall, effectively extending the local growing season. You also might benefit from raised beds if:

You lack good soil. It’s challenging to grow anything in gritty sand, dense clay, or soil studded with rocks and tangled with roots. And soil that is contaminated with lead or other toxins isn’t safe to plant in. As Caleb Goossen, of Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners, told me, with raised beds, “You can control the soil.” Raised beds can be filled with a nutrient-rich blend of compost and soil. To save money, you can try layering natural materials using the lasagna method, which requires only about 6 inches of soil, added at the end. (Fall is a great time to begin this process.)

You struggle with weeds. Weeds can set up shop in a raised bed, but a wooden or metal frame acts as a buffer and greatly slows them down. It’s also a heck of a lot easier to run a string trimmer around the edge of a raised bed than it is to maintain a border between lawn and vegetable patch. Lining the beds with landscaping fabric helps protect against weeds, and it offers a barrier against contaminated soil, but it also limits your garden’s root growth to the depth of the bed. (If the soil beneath your bed is uncontaminated and uncompacted, you can increase the planting depth by lining it with cardboard; it will decompose and allow topsoil to integrate with soil in the bed.)

You have time to water. While raised beds can improve drainage, they also typically require more-diligent watering than in-ground gardens. That’s because their exposed walls can allow heat to enter and water to exit faster than you might expect. Heavy mulch applications can help with this, in addition to adding valuable nutrients.

You need heightened garden beds. If you have trouble bending over or kneeling, or you want to grow vegetables or flowers on a patio, you might consider getting an elevated raised bed. These beds have the same benefits as traditional raised garden beds, with the added bonus of being around 3 feet high.

## How we picked

Laura Motley for NYT Wirecutter

I chose lumber that should last at least 10 years. Keeping durability in mind, I prioritized kits made with rot-resistant cedar, which can survive outdoors for anywhere from 10 to 20 years. You can find cheaper beds made with untreated SPF lumber, but they will likely rot and decay within about five years.

For metal raised beds, I was looking for ones that would last closer to 20 years. Manufacturers of metal garden beds claim these types have impressive lifespans of 20-plus years. Galvanized steel has long been revered for its excellent durability, and writer Jackie Reeve swears by Behrens tubs for easy container gardening. Many companies now employ modern, alloy-coated steel, like ZAM or Aluzinc, for their beds. These metals provide greater corrosion-resistance than traditional galvanized steel, and in theory they can last outdoors for decades.

I sought beds with straightforward assembly, requiring few tools. If you’re a skilled carpenter, you probably want to design and build your own custom raised bed. If you have middling or nonexistent carpentry skills, though, you likely want a raised bed that’s easy to assemble, with clear instructions. I looked for raised-bed kits that could be assembled by one person in under an hour. Most beds required, at a minimum, a Phillips head screwdriver to tighten bolts and screws, but some required a drill.

I also looked for versatility in bed shape and size. I decided to focus on 4-by-8-foot beds; these dimensions are ideal for a highly productive home garden. Some manufacturers offer different depth options, and they can be helpful, depending on what you plan to grow. All of the metal raised-bed kits I tested were modular in design, so a single kit could be assembled in several different configurations. This design is beneficial for smaller yards, or for when you need to capture a specific patch of late-afternoon sunlight. With wooden beds, I sought models that come in multiple sizes.

Finally, I considered the general visual appeal of the beds. Since raised garden beds become semipermanent fixtures in your yard, they should be easy on the eyes. Cedar beds with simple hardware looked elegant and classic. With metal beds, I appreciated models that offered an appealing array of paint colors and those with safety edging along the top, to hide unsightly panel corners.

## How we tested

I assembled the beds at a local elementary school. In order to test seven raised beds simultaneously, I needed space — lots of it. As the nascent chair (and lone member) of the recently revived PTA greening committee at my kids’ elementary school, I sought and gained approval to build the beds on school grounds in Portland, Maine. Working with a few parent volunteers, I scrutinized the instructions for each bed, timed the assembly from start to finish, and took note of any tools required.

I filled the beds with a blend of compost and soil — and plants. After lining the beds with landscaping fabric (for weed suppression), I filled each one with a blend of compost and soil. Some eager kids helped with this task, and I took note as they bumped and bashed the beds with wheelbarrows and shovels. I watched for nicks, dents, and dings in the sides of the beds, and I assessed how well the materials withstood the hundreds of pounds of pressure exerted by the soil. Students then filled the beds with hundreds of flower and vegetable seedlings that they’d germinated in class.

I waited for the beds to settle on less-than-level ground. Because I assembled seven beds simultaneously, I wasn’t able to be very particular in our search for level ground. After just a few weeks, I noticed which beds were still perfectly square, despite being placed on uneven ground, and which ones were already starting to suffer from weakened corners.

I took the temperature of the soil in each bed on a sunny day. Curious to find out whether the soil in the metal beds was consistently hotter than the soil in the wooden beds, I inserted a kitchen thermometer 6 inches into each bed, and then I tested the soil in the ground to compare the temperatures.

With sturdy hardware and rot-resistant cedar, this bed can be assembled using only a drill and a rubber mallet. It’s got a high price tag, but it’s fair considering the quality of materials, and it ought to last a decade.

The Gardener’s Supply Company Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed is handsome and sturdy, and the high-quality lumber and powder-coated aluminum corner brackets will likely survive many years of gardening. At just under 15 inches tall, this bed offers a depth of soil that can support many varieties of flowers and vegetables, and it’s available in four different lengths, ranging from 4 feet to 12 feet. I tested the 4-by-8-foot version.

It uses excellent-quality cedar boards. The cedar boards that came with the kit were smooth and attractive, and they should last for around 15 years. One side of each board was planed and smooth (or “finished,” in lumber speak), while the other side was rough. The instructions said to place the rough sides facing inward and the finished sides outward, and this gave the assembled bed a polished look. A few of the boards were slightly bowed, but they straightened out once we screwed in the internal hardware (called “flat stock”).

The boards measure 13/16 inches thick. So they’re thicker than the rough-cut Greenes Fence boards but thinner than the finished cedar 2-by-6 boards in the DIY bed. Mike Friedman told me that even though thicker boards are stronger, the thing that affects durability the most is drainage. “If you have a thick board that is constantly wet, then it will rot or decay faster regardless, whereas if you have a thinner board but good drainage, then it can last a really long time,” he explained. Gardener’s Supply Company sells a waterproofer, made with juniper oil, that’s intended to extend the life of the wood, but I haven’t tested it.

The hardware is durable, attractive, and sturdy. Gardener’s Supply Company’s signature black powder-coated aluminum corners are easy to install and exceptionally strong. After you slide the cedar boards into the corners, making sure they’re fully seated and level with the bottoms of the corners, you secure them with the provided screws. None of the screws are visible from the outside, and that lends elegant appeal. During testing, this bed was placed on a slightly uneven surface, and after three weeks, all four corners were still perfectly square; this was not the case with the other two wooden beds in the test.

Assembly is fairly easy, but the box is huge and heavy. The instructions for the Gardener’s Supply bed were on a single piece of paper, and it took some deciphering to figure out the process. But once I laid out all of the boards and hardware, this bed came together quickly: I assembled it in about 40 minutes. Assembly required using a drill and a rubber mallet, and Gardener’s Supply provided a buffer of six extra screws. Because some of the boards are 8 feet long, this kit was shipped in a very large box, which took two people to carry.

It’s the ideal size for a beginner home garden. The 4-by-8-foot model is the perfect size for most home gardens because it can support a large amount of several types of vegetables. Gardeners generally agree that when a bed is wider than 4 feet, it’s difficult to access the center. If you’re planning on gardening with small children (or you have a petite yard), and you want something that provides even easier access, consider buying this bed in the 2-foot-wide or 3-foot-wide version. This bed is just under 15 inches tall, and this is an ideal height for shallow-rooted plants, like lettuce and herbs, but it can also accommodate some medium-rooted vegetables, including tomatoes and eggplant. To fill this bed, you’ll need about 1.5 cubic yards of soil, which many local nurseries will deliver for a fee.

### Flaws but not dealbreakers

This is one of the most expensive beds. The Gardener’s Supply Company’s Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed costs about $100 more than the two metal raised beds we recommend, both of which will probably outlast the Gardener’s Supply bed. But finished cedar lumber is expensive, whether you buy it as part of a kit or DIY-style from a lumberyard, so the price is fair.

Despite the “Deep Root” in this bed’s name, its soil depth is best suited for growing shallow- and medium-rooted vegetables. This bed offers the bare minimum of depth recommended for growing medium-rooted vegetables, like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant. To compensate for cramped roots, you can always offer those plants extra support. But if your goal is easy and abundant tomato production, you might be better off with a taller version of one of the metal beds.

Key specs

- Materials: untreated cedar boards, powder-coated aluminum corners, stainless steel Phillips screws
- Dimensions: 48 by 96 by 14.75 inches
- Soil requirements: 40 cubic feet

The Gardener’s Supply Company Elevated Cedar Planter Box is basically a smaller, elevated version of the Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed. This bed is a great option for those who struggle to bend or kneel, and it provides excellent drainage, but the extra-shallow planting depth limits the variety of plants you can successfully grow.

It’s simple to put together. Gardener’s Supply Company provides comprehensive instructions for assembling this elevated bed, compared with the rather spare instructions that come with its Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed. This bed’s instructions contain detailed images for each step of assembly. And the two end panels come preassembled, which is a nice, labor-saving gesture. The bed came together in just under 45 minutes, and assembly required only a drill and a rubber mallet. The hardware, lumber, end panels, and floor planks fit together precisely, making my job easy.

Laura Motley for NYT Wirecutter

This bed adds beauty to your outdoor space. The planting box is elevated in more ways than one: It stands 29 inches high, and it has a simple, elegant look that will complement most outdoor decor and furniture. The cedar boards, which are rough on one side and finished on the other, eventually fade to a silvery-gray, and the rust-proof, powder-coated aluminum hardware is built to withstand the elements. So this bed’s aesthetic appeal will only improve with age. And because it adds some height to a garden, this bed also looks great alongside other, lower raised beds.

It’s remarkably durable and provides optimal drainage. In 2019, editor Hannah Morrill placed four of these beds on her porch in Portland, Maine. The beds have since survived six winters, with very little wear and tear. “They have faded to gray like all cedar does, but the integrity of the wood remains the same,” she told me. The elevated cedar planting box that I assembled at the elementary school was placed on a relatively uneven woodchip pathway. Yet the aluminum corners are so sturdy that the box shows zero signs of strain, despite its unbalanced footing. And because this bed is raised above the ground, it has built-in drainage, which will help preserve the cedar boards for even longer.

### Flaws but not dealbreakers

The planting depth is shallow. Although the Gardener’s Supply Company Elevated Cedar Planter Box is 15 inches tall, its planting depth is only 10 inches. That’s a fine depth for growing shallow-rooted vegetables, like herbs, lettuces, radishes, and strawberries, but it’s less ideal for medium- or deep-rooted vegetables, like tomatoes, kale, and eggplant. It’s possible to grow some of these plants in shallow soil, but you should probably offer them extra support, to compensate for their cramped roots.

This bed requires potting soil, which costs more than garden soil. Gardener’s Supply Company says you must fill this planter with potting soil (not garden soil) because it drains well and resists compaction. So this box is ideal for container gardens that are not integrated with the ground. But potting soil increases the cost: One cubic foot of organic potting mix is about $20, whereas the same amount of organic garden soil costs about $12.

Soil can fall through the planks. The six floor planks, which nestle neatly into the frame, are spaced to allow for proper drainage. Unfortunately, the spaces also allow lots of soil to fall through. So before I filled the bed, I lined the planks with landscaping cloth.

Key specs

- Materials: untreated cedar boards, powder-coated aluminum corners, stainless steel Phillips screws
- Dimensions: 23.5 by 48 by 29 inches; soil depth of 10.5 inches
- Soil requirements: 6 cubic feet of potting soil

The Vego Garden 17" Tall 10 In 1 Jumbo Modular Metal Raised Garden Bed Kit is a cinch to assemble, and the bed is stylish and ultra-durable. It comes in seven modern colors, and you can assemble it in several different configurations. Because it’s made with corrosion-resistant metal alloy, this bed purportedly lasts for about 20 years — almost enough time to learn how to grow great tomatoes.

It arrives in a compact, maneuverable box, and it’s easy to assemble. This garden bed’s 12 corrugated metal panels nest together tidily, so the package is remarkably small. When I was assembling the bed, the most tedious part was removing the protective plastic coating from both sides of each panel. After the panels were laid out, it was easy to put them together using the fastener sets (bolts, nuts, and washers). But there were 72 sets, so the process took about 45 minutes (a wrench is included to help with tightening). And I used a drill to speed things along. All told, I assembled the bed in just under an hour.

It’s very versatile. In addition to the array of color options and the 10 possible configurations, this bed comes in four different heights, from 11 inches to 32 inches. (You’ll pay more for the taller options.) The tallest bed requires a ton of soil (or the company-recommended Hugelkultur method), but this model is helpful for people who can't comfortably bend over. The 17-inch tall bed, which I tested and recommend for most people, is an ideal depth. It can accommodate medium-rooted plants, like tomatoes and kale, but it doesn’t require an exorbitant amount of soil.

Some of the suggested modular configurations are a little redundant (is there really a noticeable difference between a 5.5-by-6.5-foot bed and a 6-by-6-foot model?). And some use only eight or 10 of the 12 provided panels, which seems wasteful (though there may be circumstances in which extra options are useful). This bed does not have a bottom, and this allows for optimal drainage. You can line it with landscaping cloth, to suppress weeds or to provide a buffer between contaminated soil and the soil you’re using to grow things.

It’s made with corrosion-resistant and reflective metal. Vego Gardens recently switched from using Aluzinc to a product it calls VZ 2.0, which is galvanized steel substrate coated in a layer of zinc, aluminum, and magnesium. (The magnesium replaces Aluzinc’s silicon.) The company claims that magnesium offers superior corrosion resistance and is especially protective in alkaline and acidic environments.

Vego Gardens started selling raised beds in 2020, so time will tell if they truly last beyond 20 years, but the science behind the material it uses is promising. In this 2024 Reddit thread, several people reported that their Vego Garden beds were in great shape after being used for three or four years. Galvanized steel with this type of coating also offers superior reflectivity, which likely explains why this bed’s metal panels were never uncomfortably hot to the touch, even in direct sunlight.

It’s a great deal, especially considering its expected lifespan. This raised bed has an approachable price, so it’s a worthwhile investment, and it’s frequently on sale. And this model will likely outlast the pricier Gardener’s Supply Company Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed.

Thoughtful details set it apart. I appreciated that the Vego Garden bed included cap nuts for the fastener sets used in the top two rows. As a result, there were no sharp bolt ends sticking into the bed’s interior, which was especially helpful when kids worked in the garden. The rubber edging lining the top of the bed also protects against pointy metal panel corners, and it gives the bed a polished look.

### Flaws but not dealbreakers:

It ships with a lot of plastic. With the other metal beds we tested, each panel had only one side lined with plastic, for protection during shipping. We’re not sure why Vego Gardens lines both sides of its panels, but it seemed like an awful lot of non-recyclable trash.

During testing, the soil was slightly warmer in this bed than it was in the wooden beds. In my testing, the soil in the Vego Garden bed was consistently about 5 degrees warmer than the soil in the wooden beds. This was actually a benefit in temperate Maine, where I conducted the testing, but it could be an issue if you live in a hot climate. Some gardeners recommend choosing a light paint color or piling mulch against the outside of the bed for further insulation.

Key specs

- Materials: metal alloy panels, stainless steel hardware and bracing, plastic safety edging
- Dimensions: 94 by 47.5 by 17 inches
- Soil requirements: 45 cubic feet

The Birdies Large Modular Metal Raised Garden Bed Kit is another excellent metal raised bed. Inspired by Australian farmers who repurposed old metal water tanks as garden beds, Birdies introduced its ultra-durable corrugated metal raised bed kits in 2009.

This bed is also very easy to assemble. Similar to the time it took to build the Vego Garden bed, this bed took about an hour to assemble. The instructions were fairly clear, with helpful illustrations, and this kit had only 62 bolts and nuts to screw in, compared with the Vego Garden bed’s 72 fastener sets. I used a drill to speed up the tightening process. The metal panels were covered in plastic, which had to be peeled off before assembly, but it was only on one side (unlike the Vego Garden bed’s panels, which had plastic on both sides).

Laura Motley for NYT Wirecutter

Wire bracing offered extra support, which certain dimensions require, and it was easy to install. Like the Vego Garden bed, this bed also arrived in a surprisingly compact box. But the Birdies box was sealed without tape, so it was easy to break down and use as a bed liner, in lieu of landscaping fabric. (And just like the Vego Garden bed, the Birdies bed has no bottom.)

The metal panels are exceptionally durable and likely to last decades. Birdies garden beds are made with long-lasting and reflective ZAM coated steel, which, like Vego Garden’s VZ 2.0, is galvanized steel substrate coated in zinc, aluminum, and magnesium. Because Birdies has been around since 2009, there is online proof that the beds last. This YouTube video offers a detailed explanation of the state of one person’s Birdies bed after 12 years of use. (Spoiler alert: It’s in great shape, with the exception of some wear on the plastic cap lining the top edge of the bed.)

Laura Motley for NYT Wirecutter

It’s modular and versatile. Like the Vego Garden bed, this bed can be assembled in five different configurations. I went with the 4-by-8-foot version. It comes in only two heights, though, and four colors. But this bed essentially offers the same level of adaptability. If you go with a 2-, 3-, or 4-foot-wide configuration, you’ll want to install the included wire support braces.

The price is competitive with those of other metal beds. This garden bed’s price is comparable to that of the Vego Garden bed, and just like the Vego bed, this one is frequently on sale. Epic Gardening (the company that sells Birdies beds to the US market) offers free shipping for orders over $79.

Some gardeners appreciate its manufacturing origin. Birdies initially introduced its product to Australian gardeners and has since expanded globally. Its beds continue to be manufactured in Australia, with Australian steel. This distinction is meaningful to some gardeners, especially as a subtle contrast with the Vego bed, which is made in China.

### Flaws but not dealbreakers

Like soil in the Vego Garden bed, soil in this bed is consistently warmer than soil in wooden beds. I tested this bed and the Vego Garden bed in their versions of light green, and the soil in both beds was about 5 to 7 degrees warmer than soil in wooden beds. Opt for the “Light Clay” paint color if you live in a hot climate and are concerned about too-hot soil, or go with a wooden option instead.

This bed comes in only two heights. Just like with the Gardener’s Supply Co. Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed, this bed’s 15 inches of soil depth limits the variety of plants you can successfully grow. You can opt for the 29-inch deep version of this bed, but it requires almost twice the amount of soil. I preferred the Vego Garden’s 17-inch depth — those 2 inches can make a meaningful difference to plants like tomatoes and peppers.

The protruding bolt ends are ever-so-slightly treacherous. I wish the Birdies bed had cap nuts to cover the protruding bolts on the top two rows of the interior of the bed, like the Vego Garden bed has. The unprotected bolt tips can scrape against your hands as you weed and plant.

Key specs

## Best for self-customization options: Oldcastle Planter Wall Blocks

Jessica Bell/NYT Wirecutter

Many gardeners, including some at Wirecutter, recommend Oldcastle Planter Wall Blocks as a customizable option for raised garden beds. The square cement blocks are notched on all four sides, allowing for modular construction. If you don’t own a drill, but you’re interested in making a custom bed, these blocks will work well. But these beds take more work to build, and they won’t save you much money.

Assembly is incredibly fast. Once you’ve unloaded and laid out your blocks and lumber, it takes about five minutes to put together a 4-by-8-foot garden bed. You simply slide the lumber into the notched ends, stacking lumber and blocks as needed. (The blocks are 7.5 inches high, so each block can accommodate one 2-by-6 board. For a 12-inch-deep bed, you’ll need eight blocks total, with two stacked at each corner.)

You don’t need a drill. Our other picks require a drill for assembly. If that’s an obstacle for you, this option skips that step.

The blocks are inexpensive (but don’t forget the lumber). These blocks are around $4 each, so I spent around $37 on eight blocks, including delivery. However, if you buy good lumber, the total cost goes up considerably.

Due to their modular nature, these blocks are endlessly customizable. Maybe you’re chasing a specific patch of direct sun in your yard, or maybe you want to maximize a small space. Or perhaps you find squares and rectangles boring. With the Oldcastle Planter Wall Blocks, you can build L-shaped beds, U-shaped beds, and elegant tiered beds. You can also start with a small bed, perhaps a 4-by-4-foot model, and then add onto it later, by sliding lumber into open notches on the existing blocks and purchasing more blocks as needed. (Be warned: One successful growing season will likely generate an irrational desire to expand your garden during subsequent seasons.)

The notches require specific lumber. Because the notches in the Oldcastle Planter Wall Blocks measure 1⅝ inches, they can fit only finished 2-by-6 boards. (A finished 2-by-6 board actually measures 1.5 by 5.5 inches: Its nominal dimension — “2-by-6,” in this case — refers to the size of the board before it was dried and planed.) This isn’t an issue if you plan to use commonly available stock lumber, such as pine or fir.

This bed costs more money to build than similar premade kit options. If you opt for inexpensive lumber, such as pine or fir, and you stop at 12 inches of soil depth, you could build this DIY option for just over $100. That’s not a good value, though, since those types of wood have much shorter lifespans than the kind of cedar that distinguishes the other raised-bed kits. Home Depot or Lowe’s didn’t have any cedar in stock when I needed it, so I went to a local lumber yard. That place had inexpensive, rough-cut cedar, but only in 1-by-6 dimensions, so I had to go with finished 2-by-6 cedar that would fit in the notches. For a 4-by-8-foot bed with a foot of depth, I needed 48 feet of finished cedar, which cost around $390. In total, this bed ended up costing more than the Gardener’s Supply Company Deep Root Cedar Raised Bed. If you’re interested in using long-lasting cedar, the Gardener’s Supply Company bed is a better deal. But to get a custom-size bed to fit your space, this DIY option might be worth the cost.

A level surface is more necessary here than with other options. Our other picks could handle slight imperfections in grade. But with this method, those can show through, pushing the pieces out of alignment. To keep things looking square, reinforcements such as rebar (which slides into the holes in the blocks) and concrete adhesive are options to consider.

Key specs

- Materials: concrete blocks and lumber, plus optional rebar and concrete adhesive

## The competition

The Greenes Fence Co Original Cedar Raised Garden Bed arrived in a compact, lightweight box and was remarkably easy to put together, employing clever dovetail joints in lieu of hardware. But some of the unfinished cedar boards were quite bowed, and others were cracked or splintered. The 4-foot-long, 3.5-inch-wide boards were only 5/8 of an inch thick, which made them the thinnest lumber in the test. In theory, this means they’re less durable than beds made with thicker lumber. The lack of hardware contributed to the ease of assembly, but it also meant that the boards didn’t feel secure in the corner posts.

The Landguard Galvanized Raised Bed Garden Kit is very inexpensive, and it’s just as easy to assemble as the other high-quality metal beds. But it doesn’t have plastic safety edging, so the sharp corners of its metal panels may pose a slight risk to gardeners. And rather than employing a more corrosive-resistant metal, like Aluzinc, it uses galvanized steel, which is cheaper but less durable.

The Outdoor Living Today 6x3 Raised Garden Bed was intriguing for its finished red cedar boards and enticing accessories. But its dimensions are less than ideal: At 33.5 inches high, it requires a lot of soil, even though it measures only 6 feet by 3 feet. Plus accessories like a deer-proof fence and trellis or a greenhouse cover will drive up the already-high price.
