## Content (from Notion)

Today, Amazon Q Developer announced support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Amazon Q Developer Command Line Interface (CLI), enabling developers to leverage tools and prompts to support richer contextual, development workflows. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how AI models can, in a secure and structured way, access external tools, data sources, and APIs.

Before this launch, you could only use the tools that were natively available in Q Developer CLI to help generate code and execute development workflows. With MCP tools support, now you can integrate into Q Developer CLI tools from an expansive list of AWS pre-built integrations or MCP Servers that support the stdio transport layer. This allows Q Developer to provide more customized responses by orchestrating tasks across native and MCP server based tools.

To get started with using an MCP server in Amazon Q Developer CLI and explore its new capabilities, visit the Amazon Q Developer documentation or read this blog to learn more.
