# Trails

## Overview (from Notion)
- Explore the intersection of technology and human behavior through the thematic links, reflecting on how self-deception can affect decision-making in both personal and professional contexts.
- Consider how innovative ideas often emerge independently, paralleling your experiences in software development and entrepreneurship.
- Reflect on the implications of "winners eliminate competition," relating to the competitive landscape in NYC's tech scene.

- Ponder the idea that large-scale coordination stems from small-scale trust, which can resonate in your role as a founder and leader.
- Challenge the notion of open systems leading to monopolies—what does that mean for your business model?
- Engage with the concept of "measuring trust" in both personal relationships and business dealings, especially in a city where networking is crucial.
