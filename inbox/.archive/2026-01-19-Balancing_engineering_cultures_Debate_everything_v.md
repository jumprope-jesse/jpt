# Balancing engineering cultures: Debate everything vs. just tell me what to build | Hacker News

## Overview (from Notion)
- Navigating decision-making in a growing team can be challenging, impacting project efficiency and morale.
- The tension between facilitating collaboration and making decisive calls can resonate with your experience in leadership as a founder.
- Striking a balance between structured processes and agile decision-making is crucial to avoid stagnation.
- The emphasis on clear decision-makers can enhance accountability and speed up project execution.
- Consider the value of fostering a culture where feedback is welcomed but not at the expense of progress.
- Alternate views might argue for more democratic decision-making, emphasizing collaboration and team input, which can be beneficial in creative environments.
- Reflect on how these dynamics affect your role as a father—teaching your kids about decision-making, responsibility, and the importance of clear communication.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Weak leadership and consensus-seeking can lead to endless debates and slow progress in decision-making. Product managers who focus too much on process and facilitation may hinder clarity on what to build, resulting in excessive meetings without concrete conclusions.

This is the most common failure mode I’ve experienced:

> A critical piece of avoiding endless debate is to know who makes the final decision and how it gets made. Consensus-seeking leads to endless debate.

Every rapidly growing company I’ve worked for has reached a point where we have product managers and program managers and engineers and engineering managers and stakeholders and suddenly nobody can even identify who is the decision maker.

Weak leadership then pushes a “we all have to work together to come up with a solution” angle that clarifies nothing and turns everything into a consensus-building operation. Progress slows to a crawl.

The second most common failure mode I’ve seen is, I hate to say it, similar to what this author is proposing as a solution: Product Managers who view themselves as facilitators of a process where they get others to come up with the answers about what to build. The product managers call meetings where they shuffle context and requirements and suggestions from stakeholders to engineers and customers and back and forth under the idea that their job is to lead others to the conclusion. I’ve worked with some product managers who produced prodigious amounts of meetings and slide decks and Figma charts and process documents and Notion pages and after meeting summary e-mails but can never actually conclude what we should build. They’re so enamored with process and documents and afraid of being prescriptive, so you only get questions and prompts and meetings and frameworks to follow to supposedly arrive at a conclusion about what to build.
