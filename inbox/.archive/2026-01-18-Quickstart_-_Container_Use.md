# Quickstart - Container Use

## Overview (from Notion)
- Embrace containerization to streamline your software projects, ensuring clean environments that avoid conflicts, which is crucial when juggling multiple responsibilities.
- Leverage this technology to enhance collaboration with your team, allowing them to test and deploy features without impacting your main codebase.
- Consider the potential for remote work; containerized environments can simplify onboarding new developers in NYC's competitive job market.
- Explore the sustainability angle: containerization can lead to more efficient resource use, aligning with eco-conscious practices.
- Reflect on the balance between work and family time; container technologies can automate repetitive tasks, giving you more time for personal pursuits.
- Alternate view: while containerization offers many benefits, it may introduce complexity; assess if the learning curve aligns with your current priorities and projects.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Install Container Use, connect it to a coding agent, and utilize isolated environments for workflows. Ensure Docker and Git are installed, and use container-use stdio for MCP-compatible agents. Create a demo repository, prompt the agent, and review its changes while keeping your local directory untouched. Accept the agent's work or stage changes for your own commit.

In this quickstart, you’ll install Container Use, connect it to your coding agent, and experience the core workflow: agents work in isolated environments while your files stay untouched, then review and decide what to do with their work.  Make sure you have Docker and Git installed before starting.   Container Use works with any MCP-compatible agent: Just add container-use stdio as an MCP server. This example uses Claude Code but you can view instructions for other agents.   Let’s create a demo repository and ask your agent to build something:  Now prompt your agent to do something:  After a short run you’ll see something like:   Notice your local directory is still empty, because the agent worked in an isolated environment:  You can see all environments with container-use list.  See what the agent changed:  Check out the environment locally to explore:   Accept the work and keep the agent’s commit history:  Or stage the changes to create your own commit:  🎉 That’s it – you’ve run an agent in parallel, checked its work, and decided what to do with it.
