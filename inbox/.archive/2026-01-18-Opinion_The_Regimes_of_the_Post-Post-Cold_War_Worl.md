# Opinion | The Regimes of the Post-Post-Cold War World - The New York Times

## Content (from Notion)

Credit...Alain Pilon

My last newsletter before Thanksgiving was devoted to an argument about the potential resilience of both liberalism and democracy, even in a world where the post-Cold War liberal order becomes a distant memory. So naturally, this week, the president of South Korea, one of America’s most important democratic allies, decided to declare martial law.

Yoon Suk Yeol’s bizarre quasi-coup failed quickly and ignominiously, so you could say that it served, in its own way, as proof of liberal-democratic resilience. But if two weeks ago I was emphasizing the ways in which liberalism might benefit from a return to the more multipolar and ideologically contested pre-1989 world — by trading hubris for hardheadedness, absolutism for realism — in South Korea’s modern history and its present situation you have a reminder of just how much more fraught that world can be.

The non-totalitarian half of the Korean Peninsula became a stable democracy only in the last years of the Cold War, and even in the End of History era its internal politics have been anything but smooth. So if the post-post-Cold War world ends up looking more like 1945-89, we should probably expect more convulsions in countries that came late to the liberal order — and particularly in countries like South Korea that are especially shadowed by the world’s birthrate crisis and that have threatening enemies at their door.

But at the same time, as Yoon discovered, going directly from liberal democracy to Caesarism takes a lot more than just a brazen act of will. So in thinking about what a more contested world order might mean, it’s useful to start with the political formations that might take shape if liberal democracy isn’t simply overthrown, but instead evolves into a variety of regimes that mix liberal and post-liberal elements.

Such formations are taking shape already. Start with the model that many populist and right-wing parties have been seeking — a kind of fortress nationalism, in which the aim of the regime is to preserve and protect an embattled national identity and culture, a set of ethnic and linguistic and religious distinctives, by sharply limiting immigration and using state power for culturally conservative ends.

This is the model of Viktor Orban’s Hungary, most notably, but also the direction sought by many of the nationalist parties in Europe — with Giorgia Meloni’s in Italy and the Law and Justice Party in Poland being the most politically successful examples, and a rightward-shifting Israel representing a variation on the theme as well.

It’s a model that departs from liberalism in its post-1989 form by rejecting open borders and multiculturalism and taking a dim view of the rights of noncitizens. And it may tend toward the kind of managed democracy, with free elections but a single dominant party tilting the playing field in its direction, that obtained during parts of the 20th century in Japan and Mexico, and arguably obtains in Hungary today.

At the same time, the partisans of fortress nationalism would argue that they are just seeking the restoration of ideas about sovereignty and identity that would have been entirely normal in post-World War II Europe — that they’re trying to revive the nationalism of Charles de Gaulle, say, not the fascism of Philippe Pétain.

They would also argue that fortress nationalism is actually necessary to preserve domestic liberty, which is undermined by the ethno-religious tensions (sometimes between immigrants and natives, sometimes between minority groups) that multiculturalism and mass migration can introduce. Indeed, some of Europe’s fortress nationalists might be better described as supporters of a fortress liberalism, where closed borders and enforced assimilation are intended to preserve feminism and free speech and social liberalism from the specter of Islamic fundamentalism. (This vision may have a special appeal in Northern Europe: Denmark, long considered the model liberal polity, is basically running an experiment in fortress liberalism right now.)

And the fortress nationalists and liberals can claim a certain vindication on this point, given that right now the main alternative adaptation to mass migration and aging native populations is what you might call managerial multiculturalism, which tries to preserve the post-1989 vision through means that look increasingly illiberal — involving the policing of speech and debate, especially, with explicit limitations on acceptable opinion and even jail time if you step too far out of line.

This is how you end up with Britain trying to suppress the ethnic and religious tensions in its increasingly diverse society by arresting people for social media posts and online trolling. Or Justin Trudeau’s Canadian government engaging in “de-banking” and other methods to smother populist protests in 2022. Or German authorities contemplating an outright ban on the nationalist Alternative for Germany Party.

Managerial multiculturalism is a model with clear appeal to certain progressive elites, because it imagines that the more utopian ambitions of the post-Cold War era can still be realized if you just give technocrats a little extra power — to police disinformation, suppress “hate speech” and sometimes remove inconvenient parties and candidates from the ballot entirely.

It has been especially appealing to elites in the non-American Anglosphere, although it may have reached certain limits in Canada and Britain, where both Trudeau and Keir Starmer are suddenly trying to move a bit rightward on mass immigration; perhaps a period of managerial multiculturalism makes fortress liberalism more appealing. On the other hand, while East Asia tends to be perceived as more nationalist than multicultural, the managerial model may become more influential if nations like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan find themselves rapidly increasing immigration in the face of population collapse.

But what about in America? Here we have both would-be fortress nationalists and would-be policemen of the managerial utopia — but neither model seems likely to impose itself successfully for very long. Our society is too diverse and porous to be governed as a fortress for prolonged periods, and it’s too sprawling and fragmented to be policed for disinformation and wrongthink, especially outside unique technological-political moments like the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

That means that we’re most likely headed for a model you might call wide-open republicanism — meaning a system that’s freer than Britain and more open to the world than Hungary, but lacks the mechanisms of consensus enforcement that we took for granted in the recent past.

This doesn’t just mean that we’ll continue to be politically polarized, with wilder policy swings whenever the coalitions change places in the White House or in Congress. It means that a whole stew of strange ideas — radical, dangerous, toxic, intriguing — will be a persistent part of our debate. It means that we’ll have more cranks in cabinet posts, more ideological obsessions and odd religious ideas circulating in the intelligentsia. It means that political peace will be established through distance (Oregon going one way and Alabama another) and balance-of-power settlements between very different ideologies, rather than through the shared consensus of a unified establishment. It means that whatever form of extremism or bigotry or paranoia you fear most will probably have greater representation in our debates than you would like.

In certain ways this system will feel like a maxing-out of liberalism, in certain ways like a retreat. It will lend itself to greater dynamism than the fortress and managerial alternatives, and countries in Europe and Asia that manage to be similarly open (bet on France over Britain or Germany, and India over any other non-Western power), will be more likely to keep up with the United States, while the more carefully managed and protected societies are likely to fall behind.

But the wide-open republic will also feel dangerous, destabilizing and anxiety-inducing, with existential stakes seeming to shadow every election and cultural debate. And if there is an actually authoritarian future awaiting America, it might be forged in reaction to those anxieties — to the fear that our society is walking on a high wire, teetering over an abyss of fractious radicalisms, and needs to be pulled back by some strong hand from the brink.

For now, though, the American future looks more open, even as our peers and allies become in different ways more closed — open to varieties of both liberalism and post-liberalism, open to whatever world is coming next.
