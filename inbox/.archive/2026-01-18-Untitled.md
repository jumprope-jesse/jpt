AWS Backup now supports copying database snapshots across AWS Regions and accounts using a single copy action. This feature supports Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Amazon Neptune, and Amazon DocumentDB snapshots. It eliminates the need for sequential copying steps.

You can use cross-Region and cross-account snapshot copies to protect against incidents like ransomware attacks and Region outages that might affect your production accounts or primary Regions. Previously, you needed to perform this as a two-step process—first copying to a different Region, and then to a different account (or vice versa). Now, by completing this in one step, you can achieve faster recovery point objectives (RPOs) while eliminating costs associated with intermediate copies. This streamlined process also simplifies the workflow by removing the need for custom scripts or Lambda functions that monitor intermediate copy status.

This feature is available for all Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora engines, Amazon Neptune and Amazon DocumentDB, in all regions where AWS Backup supports cross-Region and cross-account copying of snapshots in separate steps. You can start using this feature today through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDKs. To get started, refer the AWS Backup documentation.
