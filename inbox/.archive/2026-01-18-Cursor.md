Johannes SchicklingFounder, Prisma

After many recommendations, I finally switched from VSC to Cursor and ... wow!

It's absolutely incredible. If you like Copilot (or if you don't), you'll be blown away by Cursor. There is no going back. 🤯

Ben BernardSr. Staff Engineer, Instacart

Cursor is at least a 2x improvement over Copilot.

It's amazing having an AI pair programmer, and is an incredible accelerator for me and my team.

Andrew McCalipEngineering, Varda Space

Cursor is awesome!

Someone finally put AI into a code editor in a seamless way. It's so elegant and easy. I'm an hour in and already hooked.

Sam WhitmoreEngineering, New Computer

started using Cursor yesterday & i'm blown away. it's how Copilot should feel. i'm completely off VSCode now.

Alex MacCawEngineering, Reflect

Cursor is the best product I've used in a while - it's an AI enabled editor.

I just asked it to write a README for a project I've been working on - analyzed the code-base and worked first time.

Morgan McGuireDirector, Weights & Biases

Cursor is so good, and literally gets better/more feature-rich every couple of weeks.
