## AI Summary (from Notion)
Roon argues that AGI is inevitable and emphasizes focusing on controllable aspects of life rather than anxiety about AGI development. The discussion highlights differing views on agency, responsibility, and the need for collective action to influence the future of AI technology.

## Content (from Notion)

Roon, member of OpenAI’s technical staff, is one of the few candidates for a Worthy Opponent when discussing questions of AI capabilities development, AI existential risk and what we should do about it. Roon is alive. Roon is thinking. Roon clearly values good things over bad things. Roon is engaging with the actual questions, rather than denying or hiding from them, and unafraid to call all sorts of idiots idiots. As his profile once said, he believes spice must flow, we just do go ahead, and makes a mixture of arguments for that, some good, some bad and many absurd. Also, his account is fun as hell.

Thus, when he comes out as strongly as he seemed to do recently, attention is paid, and we got to have a relatively good discussion of key questions. While I attempt to contribute here, this post is largely aimed at preserving that discussion.

### The Initial Statement

As you would expect, Roon’s statement last week that AGI was inevitable and nothing could stop it so you should essentially spend your final days with your loved ones and hope it all works out, led to some strong reactions.

Many pointed out that AGI has to be built, at very large cost, by highly talented hardworking humans, in ways that seem entirely plausible to prevent or redirect if we decided to prevent or redirect those developments.

> Roon (from last week): Things are accelerating. Pretty much nothing needs to change course to achieve agi imo. Worrying about timelines is idle anxiety, outside your control. you should be anxious about stupid mortal things instead. Do your parents hate you? Does your wife love you?

Sounds like we should take action to get some control, then. This seems like the kind of thing we should want to be able to control.

> Connor Leahy: I would like to thank roon for having the balls to say it how it is. Now we have to do something about it, instead of rolling over and feeling sorry for ourselves and giving up.

Saying no one has any control so why try to do anything to get control back seems like the opposite of what is needed here.

### The Doubling Down

Roon’s reaction:

> Roon: buncha ⏸️ emojis harassing me today. My post was about how it’s better to be anxious about things in your control and they’re like shame on you.

Roon’s point on idle anxiety is indeed a good one. If you are not one of those trying to gain or assert some of that control, as most people on Earth are not and should not be, then of course I agree that idle anxiety is not useful. However Roon then did attempt to extend this to claim that all anxiety about AGI is idle, that no one has any control. That is where there is strong disagreement, and what is causing the reaction.

> Roon: It’s okay to watch and wonder about the dance of the gods, the clash of titans, but it’s not good to fret about the outcome. political culture encourages us to think that generalized anxiety is equivalent to civic duty.

### Connor Leahy Gives it a Shot

> Connor Leahy (responding to Roon): The gods only have power because they trick people like this into doing their bidding. It's so much easier to just submit instead of mastering divinity engineering and applying it yourself. It's so scary to admit that we do have agency, if we take it. In other words: "cope."

This is a very good attempt to identify key elements of the elephant I grasp when I notice that being in San Francisco very much does not agree with me. I always have excellent conversations during visits because the city has abducted so many of the best people, I always get excited by them, but the place feels alien, as if I am being constantly attacked by paradox spirits, visiting a deeply hostile and alien culture that has inverted many of my most sacred values and wants to eat absolutely everything. Whereas here, in New York City, I feel very much at home.

Meanwhile, back in the thread:

> Connor (continuing): I don't like shitting on roon in particular. From everything I know, he's a good guy, in another life we would have been good friends. I'm sorry for singling you out, buddy, I hope you don't take it personally.

### Roon Responds to Connor

Roon responds quite well:

> Roon: Connor, this is super well written and I honestly appreciate the scathing response. You mistake me somewhat: you, Connor, are obviously not powerless and you should do what you can to further your cause. Your students are not powerless either. I’m not asking you to give up and relent to the powers that be even a little. I’m not “e/acc” and am repelled by the idea of letting the strongest replicator win.

This is a very good response. He is pointing out that yes, some people such as Connor can influence what happens, and they in particular should try to model and influence events.

Roon is also saying that he himself is doing his best to influence events. Roon realizes that those at OpenAI matter and what they do matter.

Roon reached out to leadership on several occasions with safety concerns. When he says he was ‘wrong to worry’ I presume he means that the situation worked out and was handled, I am confident that expressing his concerns was the output of the best available decision algorithm, you want most such concerns you express to turn out fine.

Roon also worked, in the wake of events at OpenAI, to remind people of the importance of alignment work, that they should not toss it out based on those events. Which is a scary thing for him to report having to do, but expected, and it is good that he did so. I would feel better if I knew Ilya was back working at Superalignment.

And of course, Roon is constantly active on Twitter, saying things that impact the discourse, often for the better. He seems keenly aware that his actions matter, whether or not he could meaningfully slow down AGI. I actually think he perhaps could, if he put his mind to it.

The contrast here versus the original post is important. The good message is ‘do not waste time worrying too much over things you do not impact.’ The bad message is ‘no one can impact this.’

### Connor Goes Deep

Then Connor goes deep and it gets weirder, also this long post has 450k views and is aimed largely at trying to get through to Roon in particular. But also there are many others in a similar spot, so some others should read this as well. Many of you however should skip it.

> Connor: Thanks for your response Roon. You make a lot of good, well put points. It's extremely difficult to discuss "high meta" concepts like spirituality, duty and memetics even in the best of circumstances, so I appreciate that we can have this conversation even through the psychic quagmire that is twitter replies.

I like to think I got most of that, but how would I know if I was wrong?

Focusing on the one aspect of this: One must hold both concepts in one’s head at the same time.

1. The main forces shaping the world operate above the level of individual human intention & action, and you must understand how they work and flow in order to be able to influence them in ways that make things better.
1. If you are smart, think hard, and accept painful truths, you will realize the world is a machine that you can deliberately alter.
These are both ‘obviously’ true. You are in the shadow of the Elder Gods up against Cthulhu (well, technically Azathoth), the odds are against you and the situation is grim, and if we are to survive you are going to have to punch them out in the end, which means figuring out how to do that and you won’t be doing it alone.

[EDIT: Roon later responded on March 7]:

> Roon: been mulling over this, and have a few thoughts:

This is wise, as I have discussed many times elsewhere: Any theory of the good definitely has to grapple with Americans and those in advanced countries continuing to be (and perhaps increasingly being) unhappy, stressed and anxious, despite conditions in so many ways being objectively vastly better than they have ever been. For them feeling unable to have children, having no sense of a good future, and so on. Simply giving people more material wealth does not seem to sufficiently constitute the world being good, and yes this has wrecked havoc on agency, although I would cite other factors more on that.

I do agree with the last sentence, but that does not imply that the work that comes naturally to you is a good great work to be doing.

> Roon (continuing): >your spirituality is “I was just following orders"

Yes. When you take on a great work (or holy duty, or dharma) you cannot constantly relitigate whether it is the correct great work. You need to have that debate, then only revisit the debate when circumstances change and you get sufficiently powerful new information. Commitment is a very important thing.

Some great works, of course, are more obviously double-edged than others. And some will involve learning new information along the way more than others. Life partner is on the extreme ‘almost no matter what’ end of the spectrum. Building AGI (or trying to stop or alter it) is, to me, on the extreme other end.

> Roon (continuing): This doesn't mean taking orders from someone else, although I think there are many honorable and valuable arrangements where people do let a trusted Other define their duty, if the Other is more farseeing and brave than they. Arjuna must fight the battle against the Kauravas because it is the right thing to do. Oppenheimer must build the atomic bomb for the United States despite the risks of igniting the atmosphere or creating a violent geopolitical situation. An Oppenheimer who didn't recognize and commit to his duty, hung in limbo by indecision, would've ceded the bomb to the Germans.

Not the best examples, one might say. The Russians would of course have eventually built the bomb regardless, but as I understand it the Germans never got that close and the top brass understood Russia as the true enemy the whole time.

I have never read the Bhagavad Gita, but on local reading this also seems like a not great example to me? That it is fine to kill people because their soul is distinct from their body?

> Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2: O Arjuna, the Spirit that dwells in the body of all beings is eternally indestructible. Therefore, you should not mourn for anybody.

And also it is fine to kill your friends in battle because they started it and the war must end, Krishna said so? Which is now combining four arguments that seem distinct from each other (authority, spirit, blame and resolution), the whole thing seems highly suspicious.

> Seeing the world at the end of the Path as perfectly mechanical is a noble goal but likely unrealistic -- I can't calculate all futures. Persistent action requires faith; faithless, noncommital action that constantly demands evidence for its perpetuation will fail.

There is a difference between knowing there is a path, seeing the path and walking the path, between knowing the future is mechanical, being able to calculate how to change its path and being able to execute on that. In practice, yes, you need to figure out what you believe is right, then act on it, and have what in many ways looks like faith during the day to day. You also need to be able to step outside that faith, or withdraw it, when it stops making sense.

### A Question of Agency

Meanwhile, some more wise words:

> Roon: it is impossible to wield agency well without having fun with it; and yet wielding any amount of real power requires a level of care that makes it hard to have fun. It works until it doesn’t.

Also see:

> Roon: people will always think my vague tweets are about agi but they’re about love

And also from this week:

> Roon: once you accept the capabilities vs alignment framing it’s all over and you become mind killed

What would be a better framing? The issue is that all alignment work is likely to also be capabilities work, and much of capabilities work can help with alignment.

One can and should still ask the question, does applying my agency to differentially advancing this particular thing make it more likely we will get good outcomes versus bad outcomes? That it will relatively rapidly grow our ability to control and understand what AI does versus getting AIs to be able to better do more things? What paths does this help us walk down?

Yes, collectively we absolutely have control over these questions. We can coordinate to choose a different path, and each individual can help steer towards better paths. If necessary, we can take strong collective action, including regulatory and legal action, to stop the future from wiping us out. Pointless anxiety or worry about such outcomes is indeed pointless, that should be minimized, only have the amount required to figure out and take the most useful actions.

What that implies about the best actions for a given person to take will vary widely. I am certainly not claiming to have all the answers here. I like to think Roon would agree that both of us, and many but far from all of you reading this, are in the group that can help improve the odds.
