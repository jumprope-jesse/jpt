# Self-hosting is having a moment. Ethan Sholly knows why. - Ars Technica

## Overview (from Notion)
- Self-Hosting Trend: Explore the growing interest in self-hosting as a way to regain control over personal data and reduce reliance on cloud services.
- Privacy Concerns: Consider the implications of privacy in a world full of data collection; self-hosting can provide more secure alternatives for managing family photos and documents.
- Cost Efficiency: Self-hosting can be a cost-effective solution compared to subscription services, especially for media streaming and storage.
- Community Insights: Engage with the self-hosting community for shared experiences and recommendations; platforms like selfh.st can be valuable resources.
- Hobby vs. Necessity: Reflect on the balance between self-hosting as a fun project versus a practical necessity for privacy and data management.
- Tech Savvy Kids: Introduce your children to self-hosting concepts, fostering their interest in technology and data privacy at an early age.
- Alternate Views: Some may argue that self-hosting can be complex and time-consuming; consider whether the benefits outweigh the effort, especially with the availability of user-friendly cloud services.
- Future of Computing: Think about the implications of self-hosting for the future of computing and how it might shape family tech usage and education.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Self-hosting is gaining popularity for its privacy, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility, with many users turning to platforms like selfh.st for resources. Ethan Sholly highlights the community's motivations, including a desire for control over data and the use of affordable hardware like Raspberry Pi, while also acknowledging piracy as a factor in its growth.

Self-hosting is having a moment, even if it's hard to define exactly what it is.

It's a niche that goes beyond regular computing devices and networks but falls short of a full-on home lab. (Most home labs involve self-hosting, but not all self-hosting makes for a home lab.) It adds privacy, provides DRM-free alternatives, and reduces advertising. It's often touted as a way to get more out of your network-attached storage (NAS), but it's much more than just backup and media streaming.

Is self-hosting just running services on your network for which most people rely on cloud companies? Broadly, yes. But take a look at the selfh.st site/podcast/newsletter, the r/selfhosted subreddit, and all the GitHub project pages that link to one another, and you'll also find things that no cloud provider offers.

Ethan Sholly, proprietor of the selfh.st site, newsletter, and occasional podcast, recently walked me through the current state of self-hosting, and he shared some of the findings from his surveys of those people doing all that small-scale server administration.

Sholly works in finance, not tech, but he was a computer science minor with just enough knowledge to get Plex working on a desktop PC for his friends and family. "I'd get a call or text: 'Can you turn your desktop on—it's movie night,'" Sholly said.

He gradually expanded to building his own tower server with 10 terabyte drives. Once he had his media-serving needs covered, the question inevitably became "What else can I self-host?" He dug in, wandered around, and found himself with tons of bookmarked GitHub repos and project pages.

Sholly, a self-professed "old-school RSS junkie," wanted one place to find the most commonly recommended apps and news about their changes and updates. It didn't exist, so he assembled it, coded it, and shared it. He also started writing about the scene in his newsletter, which has more personality and punch than you'd expect from someone in a largely open source, DIY-minded hobby.

After Plex increased subscription prices and changed its business model in March, Sholly wrote in his newsletter that, while there were valid concerns about privacy and future directions, it would be a good time to note something else: The majority of people don't donate to a single self-hosted project.

Responses to "Select the hardware option(s) used to deploy your self-hosted hardware," with "Low-powered device" at 2,000 responses, "Consumer hardware" around 1,600," and then "Desktop PC," "Custom build" close to 1,300, and enterprise, server, laptop, cloud VPS, mobile device, and other trailing.

Among roughly 3,700 responses from the self-hosting community in 2024 (nearly double the 2023 returns), 60 percent said "no" to the question "Have you donated to a self-hosted project in the last year?" This is despite Plex being in third place for respondents' favorite self-hosted application, behind Jellyfin and Home Assistant.

Sholly's surveys provide many other insights into this sub-section of a niche community, and they likely give him a perspective on what people are interested in. He can give the developers of the self-hosted, AI-capable photo tool Immich a good-natured ribbing about shipping a new mascot before other much-requested features. He knows them, for one thing, and his readers should sense the gratefulness coming through.

## Privacy, costs, and affordable small computers

Given this familiarity, I had a few big questions for Sholly about the self-hosted scene. First up: What is the difference between "home lab" and "self-hosting"? Home labs, Sholly suggested, are much more focused on hardware and networking. Home labs are often something people do in their professional lives and bring home with them. Self-hosting is something you could technically do on a laptop you keep running in a closet, Sholly said.

What gave rise to self-hosting's relative recent popularity? That led Sholly to a few answers, many of them directly relating to the corporate cloud services people typically use instead of self-hosting:

- Privacy for photos, files, and other data
- Cost of cloud hosting and storage
- Accessibility of services, through GitHub, Reddit, and sites like his
- Installation with Docker ("a game-changer for lots of people") and Unraid
- Single-board computers (SBCs) like the Raspberry Pi
- NUCS, mini-PCs, workstations, and other pandemic-popular hardware
Finally, there's the elephant in any self-hosting discussion: piracy. Sholly doesn't shy away from it as a driver of self-hosting (see the "*arr Stack" in the chart below, "arr" as in goofy pirate speak). "Look at the questions asked by the newcomers to the scene on any subreddit or forum, look at what they're asking about: It's their 'media files' and how to handle them," he said.

The apps used by folks on their journey through self-hosting, as of 2024.

Sholly self-hosts a whole bunch of services, but not everything. "It's not the end-goal, and we need to push on companies to fix the way they host their services," he said. "Convenience shouldn't be an add-on; privacy shouldn't be a value-add. A lot of services people are self-hosting, they might gladly pay for if companies gave them more organization and control."
