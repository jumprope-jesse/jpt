## Deciding on a Robot

Here are some questions you should ask yourself when deciding which supported robot to pick:

- What types of floor do you have?
- Do you need proper mopping?
- Do you want an Auto-Empty-Dock?
- Do you need a robot that detects and avoids obstacles such as cables?
- Do you have pets?
- Do you have people with long hair in your household?
- What is your budget?
- Where are you located?
- Are you comfortable with disassembling a robot?
Answering these questions should help you pick the right unit.

## Affiliate links

If you want to support the project, consider donating using GitHub sponsors instead of using affiliate links as they are part of the advertising industry, which some people might describe as bad.

If Amazon is something that you like to use, here are some affiliate links for it.

The DE ones end up supporting me, Hypfer, while the non-DE ones fund Dennis’ work. Apparently it’s easy for a US Amazon affiliate account to generate links on all the other Amazons but not the other way round.
