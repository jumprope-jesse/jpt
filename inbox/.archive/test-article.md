This is a test inbox item to verify the processor works.

Key takeaways:
1. Always communicate the "why" behind decisions
2. Trust your team but verify outcomes
3. Technical debt is a business decision, not just a tech one

Action items I noted:
- Try the "5 whys" technique in next retrospective
- Share this article with the engineering leads

Mentioned people:
