Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock securely connects foundation models (FMs) to internal company data sources for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver more relevant, context-specific, and accurate responses. Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet foundation model is now generally available on Knowledge Bases. The Claude 3 family of models is the next generation of state-of-the-art models from Anthropic.

At launch, the Claude 3 context window accepts up to 200,000 tokens (roughly 150,000 words, or over 500 pages of material). For the vast majority of workloads, Claude 3 Sonnet is faster on inputs and outputs than Anthropic’s Claude 2 and 2.1 models, with higher levels of intelligence. Claude 3 Sonnet is well-suited for tasks that require complex reasoning, quick outputs, and RAG. Sonnet is supported through the fully managed RetrieveAndGenerate API.

Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet model support for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases is now generally available in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) AWS Regions.
