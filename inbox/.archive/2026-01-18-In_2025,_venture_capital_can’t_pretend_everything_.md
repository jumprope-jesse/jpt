# In 2025, venture capital can’t pretend everything is fine any more – Pivot to AI

## Overview (from Notion)
- Impact on Investments: The venture capital landscape is shifting, particularly in AI. Understanding these trends could influence your investment choices, especially if you're considering funding tech startups.

- Innovation Opportunities: The focus on AI presents potential opportunities for innovation in your own software projects or startups. Think about how AI can be integrated into your products or services.

- Economic Climate: The report highlights economic instability. Planning for financial fluctuations can help you secure your business and personal finances, especially in a high-cost city like New York.

- Critical View on VC: The skepticism towards venture capital's current strategies suggests a need for more sustainable business models. Consider this when pitching your ideas or seeking funding.

- Cultural Commentary: The critique of the venture capital mindset may resonate with your values as a founder. Reflect on how you can build a company that prioritizes ethics and long-term success over quick returns.

- Alternative Perspectives: Some may argue that the VC model will adapt, or that AI will open up new markets. Engaging with these viewpoints could refine your own ideas and strategies.

- Community Engagement: Consider how these trends affect the tech community in NYC. Engaging with local tech meetups or forums could provide valuable insights and networking opportunities.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Venture capital is struggling, with AI being the only area attracting investment. The industry blames systemic issues and tariffs for its woes, while the future relies on hope for market recovery and IPOs, as many startups face failure and lack cash flow.

Venture capital is screwed. A bubble in AI is their last hope, and they’re betting everything on Sam Altman. It’s heartwarming.

Today, we have the Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor for Q1 2025. This is the National Venture Capital Association telling its members how things are going. It’s the view of VC from the inside. The front cover picture is the light at the end of the tunnel — and it’s an oncoming streetcar. [NVCA; NVCA, PDF]

We covered the Q3 2024 report last year. That one tried very hard to present bad news as okay news. The new report can’t even do that.

Here is the state of venture capital in early 2025:

- Venture capital is moribund except AI.
- AI is moribund except OpenAI.
- OpenAI is a weird scam that wants to burn money so fast it summons AI God.
- Nobody can cash out.
The report mostly blames venture’s woes on President Trump and his tariffs — but venture capital’s problems are systemic and you could see them coming since the zero-interest-rate era.

And they have no idea how to fix this. None at all. The report’s only plan for the future is to cross their fingers and hope.

### Trump’s tariffs have trashed everything

The Trump economic disaster is the most important material fact for the venture capital sphere. The report goes on and on about the tariffs.

Here’s the first paragraph of the report:

> With uncertainty dominating US financial markets throughout the first quarter, our prior expectation that 2025 would see a resurgence in venture capital (VC) liquidity and dealmaking has been dimmed. Should the latest iteration of tariffs stand, we expect significant pressure on fundraising and dealmaking in the near term as investors sit on the sidelines and wait for signs of market stabilization.

That is: nobody is doing deals because business can’t make plans past lunchtime.

The report somehow fails to mention the bit where the Silicon Valley VC and executive crowd worked their backsides off to elect Trump and several of them sat in the front row at his inauguration. Then they were actually surprised when the leopard ate their faces too.

### The end of zero interest

VC is hilariously unable to cope with not being in a zero-interest-rate environment.

In 2008, the global financial crisis hit. Central banks use interest rates as the brakes on an economy, so they took the brakes off to make sure money kept flowing around. Interest rates went below 1%. And interest stayed near zero for over a decade. [St Louis Fed]

But zero interest meant that if you had to get returns — say, you’re a pension fund — then there weren’t a lot of places to invest. Venture capital was one place you could put money and get returns.

This meant a flood of money into startups, and that meant all sorts of ridiculous startups got funding. Businesses that lost money on every transaction. SoftBank was setting money on fire as fast as possible, ending in the disaster of WeWork.

Borrowing money was almost free as well. Why not load up on debt?

But then inflation came along, and the Fed put interest rates back up — and suddenly there was less money. Why put money into venture capital when you could get back 5% just buying Treasury bills?

Venture capitalists were around before 2008 — including a lot of the current guys! — but it’s like they completely forgot how to do anything without free money. The party’s over, and now it’s time for the hangover.

So we get hyped up tech bubbles praying for lottery-level returns — because ordinary business returns from, say, making a thing and selling it don’t cut it. Our present hype-fueled AI bubble is a complete worked example.

### Everything is OpenAI

This year, the investors are all-in on AI. Crypto’s still dead, quantum isn’t taking off — AI’s the last game in the casino. [TechCrunch]

There’s lots of graphs in this report showing healthy dollar amounts. These are mostly the “$40 billion” OpenAI deal led by Softbank, and then the other AI startup deals. Almost all the graphs and statistics in this report are lies based on the one huge OpenAI outlier.

Andreessen Horowitz is right now raising a fresh $20 billion investment fund to try to keep the AI bubble going.

VCs still believe the marketing brochure version of AI, because they don’t actually know anything about technology:

> Just as “internet” evolved from buzzword to business backbone, AI is following the same playbook.

No it isn’t! A completely different thing taking off and working says nothing about whether your personal favourite thing will take off and work! Stop saying dumb things!

Pitchbook says: “57.9% of global VC dollars invested in Q1 went to AI and machine learning startups.” Most of that’s OpenAI. Even Pitchbook calls it “FOMO” — fear of missing out. [Pitchbook]

AI is the only prospect for a lottery-level win. You and I know that’s not going to happen, but the VCs and their customers, the investors, do not know that. They’re still in. Where else are they gonna go?

### Everything that isn’t AI is moribund

There’s a world of startups outside AI, and in 2025, they’re not having fun. Investors do not want to put money into early-stage startups with nothing to show as yet:

> First-time financing activity remains low, reflecting broader trends across the VC industry. In Q1, we recorded $3.8 billion invested across 892 deals, which was down both QoQ and YoY.

> … Only $10 billion was raised across 87 VC funds, setting a pace for the lowest year of fundraising in a decade.

Early-stage firms that do get venture funding tend to get acquired early on, instead of doing more rounds to pump their imaginary value number first.

Even when a fund gets investors, it can hardly find anywhere to put the money. One VC firm, Charles River Ventures, returned $275 million of uncommitted capital to its investors. And wasn’t that a shock to the world of VC. [NYT, archive]

### Number must go up

These companies have mostly imaginary valuations — say they pay $10 million to get 1% of a company, that makes the company worth a billion dollars, right? And not the ten million of actual money it’s got.

The VCs jealously guard these imaginary valuations as big fat book entries they can trade with each other. Just don’t ever look inside the box, don’t test what the market with actual dollars thinks the value is.

A pile of startups just ran out of cash and died in 2024 — more than in 2023. And 2025 is expected to be even worse. [TechCrunch]

A lot of these were frankly trash companies funded a few years ago, and they should have died then. But VC still had the startups’ imaginary values on their books and they didn’t want to admit the startups were worthless until they were forced to.

### Nobody can cash out

AI is the only thing that’s catching the eye of the investors. The investors don’t want to put their money into other areas because they’re just not getting payouts.

Here’s the simple version of venture capital investing:

- A VC firm starts a fund.
- Big investors — pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, super-rich family offices — put money into the fund.
- The VC firm puts the money into startups that will progress to an exit — an initial public offering or a bigger company buying them out.
- The investors get paid. Hooray!
Most startups fail, but one big winner can make up for a pile of losers.

Unfortunately, the stock market is broken — the Trump tariffs again — so IPOs are not popping on launch, so they’re not happening.

CoreWeave, riding the AI buzz for all it was worth, was the big public exit in first quarter 2025, and that one fell flat because their numbers were objectively terrible and their business plan doesn’t work. Ed Zitron has covered CoreWeave at length. But even with all that, CoreWeave on its own was 40% of all first quarter exits by value. [Where’s Your Ed At]

The other big exit was Wiz Security getting bought by Google. But as the report says, “the rest of the exit market has remained relatively silent.”

Funding rounds are increasingly late-stage — that is, VCs are mostly putting extra money into existing companies, often just to keep them on life support.

Many of these later funding rounds also have secondary sales — where startup employees get to sell some equity to the new investors. Because then the talent might not give up and quit to work at a non-zombie. And the old investors get some money back from a company that’s not doing anything.

### The future of venture capital

The report’s theme for the future is: hope really hard! Maybe markets will recover and IPOs will pop again. Maybe Trump will come up with a coherent plan and stop being volatile and weird. Maybe!

That’s it. That’s all the plan they have. These guys haven’t got a clue what to do next. They really don’t. This is the industry talking to itself and saying “well gosh, chaps, looks like we’re screwed.”

It’s important to note something else here: quite a lot of the venture capital class are not actually so bright. But they got lucky once.

That’s a big thing to say. They’re way more rich and successful than you, David. These are intelligent and educated people, they were definitely good at something! A lot of them have Ph.D.s!

But also, it’s horribly clear that right now they’re way out of their depth. Semafor documented last week how these guys enthusiastically joined a long-running billionaire group chat with literal neo-Nazis as their court philosophers. Marc Andreessen got into e/acc — which is literally a neo-Fascist revival movement. [Semafor]

This is not smart behaviour! This is dumbass behaviour!

These are not people who can be trusted with dangerous machinery such as billions of dollars. They were lucky as hell, and now they’re not.

The only future plan in this report is: maybe Trump will stop acting like a bizarre freak. They’ve met the guy and they think that’s a plan!

Maybe they can start a bubble in guillotines. [Mastodon]

Not that anything unpleasant should happen to them. None of the VC class will ever miss a meal. But you can feel a small amount of schadenfreude at their mild discomfort, while everything burns around the rest of us.
