What is FireCrawl?

FireCrawl is an advanced web crawling and data conversion tool designed to transform any website into clean, LLM-ready markdown. Ideal for AI developers and data scientists, it automates the collection, cleaning, and formatting of web data, streamlining the preparation process for Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

How does FireCrawl handle dynamic content on websites?

Unlike traditional web scrapers, FireCrawl is equipped to handle dynamic content rendered with JavaScript. It ensures comprehensive data collection from all accessible subpages, making it a reliable tool for scraping websites that rely heavily on JS for content delivery.

Why is it not crawling all the pages?

There are a few reasons why FireCrawl may not be able to crawl all the pages of a website. Some common reasons include rate limiting, and anti-scraping mechanisms, disallowing the crawler from accessing certain pages. If you're experiencing issues with the crawler, please reach out to our support team at support@mendable.ai.

Can FireCrawl crawl websites without a sitemap?

Yes, FireCrawl can access and crawl all accessible subpages of a website, even in the absence of a sitemap. This feature enables users to gather data from a wide array of web sources with minimal setup.

How does FireCrawl ensure the cleanliness of the data?

FireCrawl employs advanced algorithms to clean and structure the scraped data, removing unnecessary elements and formatting the content into readable markdown. This process ensures that the data is ready for use in LLM applications without further preprocessing.

Is FireCrawl suitable for large-scale data scraping projects?

Absolutely. FireCrawl offers various pricing plans, including a Scale plan that supports scraping of millions of pages. With features like caching and scheduled syncs, it's designed to efficiently handle large-scale data scraping and continuous updates, making it ideal for enterprises and large projects.

Is FireCrawl open-source?

Yes, it is. You can check out the repository on GitHub. Keep in mind that this repository is currently in its early stages of development. We are in the process of merging custom modules into this mono repository.

Does it respect robots.txt?

Yes, FireCrawl crawler respects the rules set in a website's robots.txt file. If you notice any issues with the way FireCrawl interacts with your website, you can adjust the robots.txt file to control the crawler's behavior. Firecrawl user agent name is "FireCrawlAgent". If you notice any behavior that is not expected, please let us know at support@mendable.ai.

What measures does FireCrawl take to handle web scraping challenges like rate limits and caching?

FireCrawl is built to navigate common web scraping challenges, including reverse proxies, rate limits, and caching. It smartly manages requests and employs caching techniques to minimize bandwidth usage and avoid triggering anti-scraping mechanisms, ensuring reliable data collection.
