# Conductor

## Overview (from Notion)
- Conductor offers a streamlined way to manage multiple coding tasks, giving you insights into project progress and potential roadblocks, which could save you valuable time.
- The isolated workspaces allow for experimentation without affecting your main codebase, perfect for trying new ideas or features.
- As a founder, it can enhance team collaboration by providing visibility into who is working on what, fostering accountability and productivity.
- The integration with Claude Code can simplify your workflow, especially if you already utilize their services, making it easier to manage your coding environment.
- Its user-friendly approach aligns with the fast-paced tech landscape in NYC, where rapid iteration and adaptability are crucial.
- Consider the balance between leveraging tools like Conductor and ensuring personal engagement with your projects—automation should complement, not replace, your oversight.
- An alternate view could argue that relying too much on automation tools might dilute hands-on coding skills, so maintaining a balance is key.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Conductor allows running multiple Claude Codes in parallel with isolated workspaces to monitor progress and issues. It integrates with your repository, operates on your Mac, and utilizes git worktrees for each workspace. Conductor supports various coding agents and uses your existing Claude Code login for payment.

Run a bunch of Claude Codes in parallel.

Each Claude gets an isolated workspace. See who’s working, see who’s stuck, and what’s changed.

Add your repo.

Conductor clones it and works entirely on your Mac.
