Mastra University

In this hands-on course, you'll learn to develop and deploy AI agents using Mastra, including how to equip them with tools, memory, and MCP. But here's the twist: you're not just learning about agents, you're learning from one.

This course is delivered entirely inside your agentic code editor, where your code agent guides you step-by-step, writes code with you, and helps you build real, working agents from the ground up.

Course Outline

Build your first agentWatch lesson 1 intro

Build and deploy your first AI agent that can read data from external sources, use custom tools, and remember previous interactions. Set up your development environment, test your agent in a live playground, and ship your agent to production. This section covers the basics needed to create a working, memory and tool-enabled agent.
