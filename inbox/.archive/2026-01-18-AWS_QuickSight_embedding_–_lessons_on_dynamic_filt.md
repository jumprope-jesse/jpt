# AWS QuickSight embedding – lessons on dynamic filters, pivot saves, RLS & SPICE vs DirectQuery? : r/aws

## Overview (from Notion)
- The migration to Redshift and embedded QuickSight reflects a growing trend in data-driven decision-making, which can resonate with your role as a software engineer and founder.
- Dynamic filters and user customization in reports may mirror your need for flexibility in managing family schedules and work-life balance.
- The emphasis on row-level security could parallel your desire to protect your family’s privacy and data in an increasingly digital world.
- Exploring SPICE vs. Direct Query can relate to optimizing time and resources in both personal and professional projects; efficiency is key.
- Sharing experiences and learning from others in tech parallels community-building as a parent—seeking advice and support is vital.
- The challenges faced in scaling solutions are akin to balancing family responsibilities with entrepreneurial pursuits—both require strategic planning and adaptability.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
A team is migrating a multi-tenant reporting app to Redshift with embedded QuickSight and seeks insights on five key areas: the reliability of dynamic filters using the JS SDK, the ability for users to save custom pivot layouts as bookmarks within the embed, requirements for CSV and .xlsx exports, the effectiveness of SPICE vs. Direct Query for large datasets, and best practices for implementing row-level security at scale.
