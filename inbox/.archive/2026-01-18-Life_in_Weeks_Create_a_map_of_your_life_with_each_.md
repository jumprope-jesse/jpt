 “Sometimes life seems really short, and other times it seems impossibly long. But this chart helps to emphasize that it’s most certainly finite. Those are your weeks and they’re all you’ve got.”     Tim Urban  Wait But Why

In 2014, blogger Tim Urban, published a post called "Your Life in Weeks," where he showed a visualization of life as a series of little squares, with each one representing a week. It's a powerful, concise way to visualize an entire human life.

This site helps you create one of those visualizations for yourself. You can use it to track key periods and events in your life, see the progress you've made over time, and easily share your life story with friends and loved ones.

I built this app after seeing Gina Tripani's interpretation of the idea, and realizing I wanted one for myself. And then I thought, well, if I want one maybe other people do too.

Check out my own life in weeks to see what you can build.
