## See how developers use AI Agent in real projects

Vibe coding as it is: your high-level guidance, and AI handles the rest. Watch use cases of Refact.ai Agent autonomously solving developers' tasks while they barely touch the keyboard.

A full-fledged IoT cloud monitoring Django app for our IoT products was 99.9% programmed using only the Refact.ai Agent. I only worked on one thing — the models.py file. It was an amazing experience with the Refact.ai Agent, it truly saved me a lot of time and energy, which I could dedicate to my main job and family. The app includes white/dark mode, UI translation editing, and permission management for each module (like TRANS for translations), as well as automatic data updates through Ajax.

80 hours of building from scratch — instead done in 30 minutes

The new programmer told me that he needed 80 hours to rewrite from scratch, as fixing it would take the same amount of time or more. So I connected Refact to the MySQL database and used the Chrome tool while logged into the WordPress admin. And guess what happened? In about 30 minutes of prompt ping-pong, it identified the issue with the plugin. I told the Agent I didn't want to update the plugin — just fix it! And it did! This freaking Agent keeps amazing me every single time.

3 weeks of waiting — solved in just 14 minutes!

Another big win story here! I also work with other AI communities, and their workload is already full, so they don't have much time for improvements. Still, I just asked the Refact.ai Agent to build me a GUI for a worker client that this community is using. Let me tell you — in just 14 minutes, the agent created the most beautiful, fully functional GUI (nothing was missing) for this client. All I did was give it the link to the GitHub repo... (They had been asking for a GUI 3 weeks ago, a few people said 'OK', but nothing was delivered.)

Refact.ai Agent handles around 95% of the work

As someone with zero prior web development experience, this Refact agent has been incredibly effective. With its intelligent support, I can now build functional web applications using a 'vibe coding' approach. I'd describe this agent as my personal paid developer — it handles around 95% of the work, including building and debugging my applications. Moreover, it helps me understand coding logic in the process, making it both a development and a learning tool.

Refact.ai Agent saved me thousands of euros

I just finished a week of vibe coding with Refact.ai, and I'm still processing how much the product development game has changed. What I particularly love about Refact.ai is that it's fully integrated — it can see your entire code repository, integrates with multiple tools, and proposes changes based on the overall architecture and project knowledge. I was able to build a working product prototype within a week with just prompting and testing. Using Refact.ai saved me thousands of euros that I would have spent hiring a freelancer. It saved me months of work — I got it done in just a week!
