Nobody tells me what to do at work. But sometimes, I tell myself to shut up.

Before we dive into the workplace, let’s talk about game theory. No, it’s not about videogames or board games like Settlers of Catan. Game theory is the study of strategic decision-making. It’s a fancy way of saying, “If I do X, and you do Y, what happens?”

## Game Theory 101: The Ukraine-Russia Conflict

Let’s look at a real-world example: the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, with NATO in the mix. Don’t worry, I’m not getting political here - just using it as an example of game theory in action.

Picture this:

- Ukraine wants to maintain its independence and potentially join NATO.
- Russia wants to prevent NATO expansion and maintain influence over Ukraine.
- NATO wants to support Ukraine without triggering a larger conflict.
Now, let’s break it down:

1. If Ukraine joins NATO:
1. If Russia invades Ukraine:
1. If NATO directly intervenes:
See how complicated this gets? Each player has to consider not just their own moves, but how others might respond. That’s game theory in a nutshell.

Now, let’s bring this back to something a bit less world-changing: your job.

## The Game of Workplace Communication

Every time you open your mouth at work, you’re playing a game. The stakes? Your reputation, relationships, and sometimes even your job. The players? You, your colleagues, your boss, your customers(!!!), and anyone else within earshot.

Let’s break down a few scenarios:

### Scenario 1. The Political Powder Keg

Should you talk about politics at work? HELL NO.

Here’s the game theory breakdown:

- If you talk and people agree: Small gain (maybe a nod of approval)
- If you talk and people disagree: Massive loss (damaged relationships, potential HR issues)
- If you stay quiet: No loss, potential small gain (being seen as professional)
The matrix is clear: you have nothing to gain and lots to lose. Keep your political views to yourself, folks.

This is a universal rule. It doesn’t matter if you’re a supporter of the Dogooder party and you know that nearly everyone aligns with you. You never have anything to gain by bringing politics into work. ∎

### Scenario 2. The Project Predicament

You’re in a meeting, and you spot a flaw in the project plan. Do you speak up?

Let’s play it out:

- If you speak up and you’re right: Moderate gain (project improves, you look smart)
- If you speak up and you’re wrong: Small loss (mild embarrassment)
- If you stay quiet and the flaw is real: Large loss (project fails, you knew and said nothing)
In this case, the potential gain outweighs the risk. Speak up, but do it thoughtfully.

### Scenario 3. The Gossip Game

Your colleague starts dishing out juicy gossip about the boss. Do you join in?

Game theory says:

- If you join and it stays secret: Tiny gain (fleeting social connection)
- If you join and it gets back to the boss: Massive loss (lost trust, potential career damage)
- If you stay quiet: No loss, potential gain (being seen as trustworthy)
Again, the smart move is to keep your mouth shut. The potential losses far outweigh any possible gains.

## The Meta-Game: Building Your Reputation

Here’s where it gets interesting. Every time you play one of these “games” at work, you’re also playing a larger meta-game: building your reputation.

Each time you choose to speak up or stay quiet, you’re sending signals about who you are:

- The person who always has something to say
- The quiet observer who speaks only when it truly matters
- The gossip
- The level-headed professional
Your reputation is the sum of all these little games you play every day. And unlike a single conversation, your reputation has long-lasting effects on your career.

## Implementing Game Theory at Work

So, how do you put this into practice?

1. Pause before you speak: Take a moment to consider the potential outcomes of your words. What’s the best-case scenario? The worst-case? Is it worth the risk?
1. Consider the long game: How will your words affect your reputation over time? Are you building the image you want? What do you have to gain or lose? What does everyone else have to gain or lose?
1. Observe the winners: Look at the most respected people in your workplace. When do they choose to speak up, and when do they stay quiet?
1. Practice strategic silence: Sometimes, the most powerful move is to say nothing at all. Let others fill the silence.
1. When you do speak, make it count: Choose your moments carefully, and when you do speak, ensure it adds real value.
Remember, nobody tells you exactly what to do at work. But with a little game theory, you can figure out when to make your move and when to hold your cards close to your chest.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to shut up and get back to work. After all, that’s what the game theory matrix tells me to do right now.
