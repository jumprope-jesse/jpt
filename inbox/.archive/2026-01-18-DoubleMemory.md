Ever wish you had a photographic memory?

Perhaps you've double-pressed ⌘ + C without realizing it—hoping your Mac might remember better. Or maybe you're a tab hoarder 👀, juggling dozens of open pages just to lose track anyway.

Yet saving and recalling information still feels like a chore—lost links, forgotten contexts, disrupted flow. Most tools follow the same recipes: browser-based, server-connected, internet required, registration needed, extensions hooked. To make the business work, they sell your data to "partners" for profit—yet still somehow fold 💣 under VC schedules.

We believed there was a better way.

That's why we built DoubleMemory 💡 — instant, effortless capture and recall for everything you save. No accounts. No servers. No tracking.

Just press ⌘ + C + C.

DoubleMemory keeps your memories at your fingertips on your device. It syncs privately with iCloud, works offline 🌐, doubles as a clipboard manager, and displays saved content in a beautiful visual board 💅.

Finally, your memory superpower unleashed...
