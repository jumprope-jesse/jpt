# The Lunacy of Artemis | Hacker News

## Overview (from Notion)
- The discussion around the SLS rocket reflects broader themes in innovation and technology, particularly the trade-offs between cost, efficiency, and legacy systems.
- As a software engineer and founder, consider how outdated technologies might be hindering progress in your projects; the need for modern solutions is crucial.
- The humor in critiques of the SLS can serve as a reminder to not take failures too seriously, embracing a more innovative and flexible mindset in your work.
- Think about how you can apply lessons from aerospace challenges to your own ventures; sometimes, starting fresh is more effective than reusing old frameworks.
- Alternate views might argue that using existing technologies can save time and money, but weigh this against the potential for innovation and the agility of newer approaches.
- Reflect on the importance of aligning your projects with current needs rather than sticking to traditional methods that may not serve your audience or goals effectively.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Critiques of the SLS rocket highlight its costly inefficiencies, comparing it to the Saturn V while noting its limited launch frequency and reliance on outdated Shuttle hardware, leading to humorous yet harsh assessments of its design and functionality.

Unkind quotes, but hilarious and probably well deserved:

"SLS looks like someone started building a Space Shuttle and ran out of legos for the orbiter"

"But on top of this monster sits a second stage so anemic that even its name (the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage) is a kind of apology."

"the minds behind SLS achieved a first in space flight, creating a rocket that is at the same time more powerful and less capable than the Saturn V."

"And SLS is a “one and done” rocket, artisanally hand-crafted by a workforce that likes to get home before traffic gets bad."

"The rocket can only launch once every two years at a cost of about four billion dollars—about twice what it would cost to light the rocket’s weight in dollar bills on fire."

"Early on, SLS designers made the catastrophic decision to reuse Shuttle hardware, which is like using Fabergé eggs to save money on an omelette."
