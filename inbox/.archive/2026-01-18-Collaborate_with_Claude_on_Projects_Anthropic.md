## Content (from Notion)

Our vision for Claude has always been to create AI systems that work alongside people and meaningfully enhance their workflows. As a step in this direction, Claude.ai Pro and Team users can now organize their chats into Projects, bringing together curated sets of knowledge and chat activity in one place—with the ability to make their best chats with Claude viewable by teammates. With this new functionality, Claude can enable idea generation, more strategic decision-making, and exceptional results.

Projects are available on Claude.ai for all Pro and Team customers, and can be powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, our latest release which outperforms its peers on a wide variety of benchmarks. Each project includes a 200K context window, the equivalent of a 500-page book, so users can add all of the relevant documents, code, and insights to enhance Claude’s effectiveness.

### Avoid the cold start problem

Projects allow you to ground Claude’s outputs in your internal knowledge—be it style guides, codebases, interview transcripts, or past work. This added context enables Claude to provide expert assistance across tasks, from writing emails like your marketing team to writing SQL queries like a data analyst.

In addition, you can define custom instructions for each Project to further tailor Claude’s responses, including instructing Claude to use a more formal tone or answer questions from the perspective of a specific role or industry. With Projects, you can get started much faster and extend your skills further for any task.

### Create side-by-side with Claude

Artifacts help you better work with Claude by helping you see, edit, and build with Claude. Simply ask Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, graphics, diagrams, or website designs, and Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside your conversation.

Artifacts especially enhance Claude’s coding capabilities for developers, offering a larger code window and live previews for frontends that streamline reviews. Join the feature preview for Artifacts in Claude.ai via the account menu on the left-side panel.

### Spark inspiration through sharing

Claude Team users can also share snapshots of their best conversations with Claude into your team’s shared project activity feed. Activity feeds help each teammate get inspired around different ways to work with Claude, and helps the entire team uplevel their skills working with AI.
