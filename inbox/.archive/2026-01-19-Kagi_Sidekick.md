## Content (from Notion)

Add fast search with Kagi smarts and AI to your personal or documentation website with just a couple lines of code.

We'll sort out the hard stuff - indexing, embeddings, vector search, and AI chat with your pages. Just integrate with two lines of code using our lightweight Web Components (20kB min+gzip) or our Docusaurus, Hugo, or VitePress plugins.

### What is the big idea?

We intend to offer Sidekick as a free service for small/personal websites and reasonably priced search option for commercial websites. The added benefit of using Kagi Sidekick is that your website will automatically (after opt-in) be indexed to show in Kagi search.

We are currently in the process of gauging demand for this service. Please register your interest and we'll notify you when it launches. You can also submit feedback in the Sidekick discussion thread.
