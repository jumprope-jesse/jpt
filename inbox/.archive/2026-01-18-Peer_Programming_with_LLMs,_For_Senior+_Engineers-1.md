# Peer Programming with LLMs, For Senior+ Engineers

## Overview (from Notion)
- Exploring ways to integrate LLMs into your daily work can enhance productivity, freeing up time for family and personal pursuits.
- The idea of using LLMs for brainstorming and planning can streamline your project management, allowing for more efficient development cycles.
- Documenting prompts can lead to better results and a more structured approach to AI assistance, which can be beneficial in a fast-paced startup environment.
- The cautionary note that LLMs aren't as intelligent as they seem can help manage expectations and encourage a balanced approach to technology.
- Being part of a community of senior engineers discussing practical AI applications can provide valuable insights and innovations that keep your skills sharp.
- Consider the potential of AI in terms of collaborative coding and debugging, which can enhance team dynamics and reduce bottlenecks in development.
- Alternate views may include skepticism about relying too heavily on AI, emphasizing the importance of human intuition and creativity in software development.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Programming with LLMs offers potential for senior engineers, combining coding assistance with peer programming. Key resources include techniques for daily work, LLM code generation workflows, and the importance of documenting prompts. Emphasizing that LLMs are tools, not infallible, can enhance their effective use in projects.

Programming with LLMs is both promising and frustrating. While these AI assistants can help with coding and debugging, they often waste time too. Yet for senior engineers, pair peer programming with LLMs shows real potential.

This article is a collection of blog posts written by other senior or staff+ engineers exploring the use of LLM in their work, without the usual hype or buzzwords from the usual suspects. I hope you find them useful and inspiring.
