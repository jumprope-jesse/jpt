Your data will never be sold

We pledge never to sell your data or access your data without your permission. We have immutable audit logs and strict code review policies.

Your data is protected from physical tampering

Decrypted data is only ever stored in memory, which is protected from tampering by a multi-chip standalone hardware cryptographic appliance.

Your data is protected from your employer & government

Your employer and the government cannot decrypt your data. If we were given a subpoena to hand over customer data it would be useless because it is undecryptable.
