# Study: 97% Of Average American’s Day Spent Retrieving 6-Digit Codes - The Onion

## Overview (from Notion)
- The study highlights a growing dependency on technology, reflecting the constant juggling act of balancing work, family, and personal time.
- As a software engineer and founder, you might find the inefficiencies in authentication processes particularly frustrating, impacting productivity and innovation.
- The staggering statistic of 97% of the day spent on retrieving codes could resonate with your daily struggles in maintaining focus amidst interruptions.
- Consider the absurdity of the situation: while technology is meant to simplify life, it often complicates it, leading to a paradox where you spend more time verifying identity than actually being productive.
- This could spark thoughts on how to create better user experiences in your own products, minimizing unnecessary friction in authentication processes.
- Alternate views might argue that increased security is necessary, but there's a case to be made for balancing security with user convenience to enhance daily life.
- Reflect on how this phenomenon could affect your children as they grow up in a tech-dominated world, potentially leading to similar challenges.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
A study reveals that the average American spends 97% of their day retrieving six-digit validation codes for online services, equating to about 23 hours daily. This obsession with codes leads to skipped meals and sleep deprivation, as individuals struggle to manage the influx of codes needed for various accounts. The issue appears to be worsening, with many unable to keep track of which codes are valid.

CHICAGO—Shedding light on how technology increasingly shapes everyday life, a study published Thursday by the American Journal Of Sociology revealed that the average American dedicates 97% of their day to retrieving six-digit validation codes. “Our findings suggest that U.S. residents spend roughly 23 hours each day—or 160 hours every week—attempting to log in to online services, being told they need to check their phone for a six-digit code, and then entering that code into the website or app for verification,” said lead researcher Andrew Singh, adding that many Americans have to skip meals and forgo showering in order to find time to read and transfer over the hundreds of codes needed daily to access their medical records, work emails, and food delivery accounts. “There’s likely a link here between most Americans only getting 20 or 30 minutes of sleep each night and the amount of their lives now given over to frantically pressing ‘Resend’ after they fail to receive a particular code, then receiving far too many codes and being unable to figure out which one is still valid. Unfortunately, it seems this problem is only getting worse.” Singh added that his study did not even factor in the many hours Americans spend standing up from their laptop and walking over to their phone after remembering they left it in the other room.
