## Charming and durable in all weather

When I started my garden, I didn’t start with Behrens tubs. I started with cheap plastic pots, but they didn’t have the look or the sizes I wanted.

Next I upgraded to terra-cotta pots … and promptly broke a lot of terra-cotta pots. They’re so pretty but so fragile. I also learned the hard way that they can crumble and crack if you leave them out year-round here in the Pacific Northwest.

I’d become familiar with Behrens as a brand. It’s hard not to when you live on a farm, and you suddenly find yourself spending all of your time at hardware stores and every local farm store in the county. Our property is now littered with Behrens trash cans (for storing chicken feed and potting soil) and square tubs (dust baths for said chickens). I even tested a Behrens watering can for our guide. I knew this company’s stuff was affordable and good in all weather.

So I picked up some secondhand Behrens tubs to try as planters. I cleaned them, drilled drainage holes in the bottoms, and planted some annuals. I wish I’d thought of these tubs first and saved myself some money, because my garden looked instantly incredible.

## Affordable enough to stock up on, especially the big sizes

I’ve tried planting lilacs around our property, but either the deer nibble them or they don’t like the soil. This year I’m trying one in a 17-gallon tub. Photo: Jackie Reeve

As my garden grew, so did the size of the pots I needed. I discovered Behrens bushels and 17-gallon round tubs at local hardware stores. And today, I have two Meyer lemon trees in bushels, so it’s easy to plop them into my greenhouse for the winter and wheel them out to my container garden for the summer. Outside my office, several bushels hold roses, peonies, and wildflowers, and my 17-gallon tubs contain a romping assortment of mints and a few shrubs, plus several dwarf apple trees in our kitchen garden. By planting trees in containers, I can control the soil mix and move the trees around if they seem unhappy with the light, which is harder to do if they’re planted in the ground. I can also companion-plant herbs and other good things around them for natural pest control.

Extra-large plant pots can get really expensive unless you score some gems secondhand. But the Behrens tubs are generously sized and made of galvanized steel (which means they have a protective zinc coating to guard against corrosion), and they cost under $30 each. My tubs have stayed sturdy and rust-free through several gardening seasons, despite being stored outside through heat waves, snow, ice, and the endless months of rain here. If I do eventually have to replace them, it won’t cost a fortune.

## The not-so-great details

Behrens makes many tubs, but some of them are harder to find than others. If I find a size I really love, I’ll get multiples to have them on hand.

The giant labels are also a pain to remove. It takes elbow grease and a fair amount of rubbing alcohol to get rid of all the sticky residue (sometimes I don’t bother and just turn the containers so the labels face away).

The handles are sturdy, but they’re small and thin—especially uncomfortable when the tubs are full of soil and actual trees. I have a few of these comfort grip handle covers, which help.

Finally, some people report that the metal can overheat their plants. This hasn’t been the case for me, but I live in the PNW, where our damp soil might protect the plants. My tubs and bushels (and the plants in them) didn’t overheat during our 2022 heat wave, when temperatures remained in the 90s for about a week. I don’t know how plants would react to longer stretches at higher temperatures. My tubs live in one of the sunniest spots in our yard year-round, and I pick summer plants that like sun and heat. On our hottest days, the handles never get too hot to touch, and my plants remain as happy as anything else outside (they do need extra watering, though, which is a downside of any container garden).

## Care and maintenance

A spray with the hose is all these tubs need, unless you’re planting something new, and then you’ll want to give them a good scrub with soap and water. For proper drainage, I drill a lot of holes in the bottom of each one (eight to 12, at least), and this also helps prevent damage to the plants and to the tubs from standing water.

Though I mostly use the tubs for growing flowers, Behrens notes that the zinc-coated galvanized tubs are safe for growing fruits and veggies—if the tubs are in good condition. “Zinc, in its finished form, does not provide a toxicity risk,” the company claims on its website. “However, like most things, if too much zinc gets in your system, or the metal has significantly deteriorated, the underlying steel can potentially leach toxins.” Behrens advises that you “regularly check the integrity” of your containers to keep your plants safe.
