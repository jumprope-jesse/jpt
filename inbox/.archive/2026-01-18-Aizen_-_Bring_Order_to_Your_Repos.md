# Aizen - Bring Order to Your Repos

## Overview (from Notion)
- Aizen offers a streamlined approach to managing multiple software projects, which is ideal for balancing work and family life—less time switching between tools means more time for both.
- The ability to work in parallel across branches allows for greater efficiency, letting you tackle complex projects without losing context.
- Its unique focus on worktrees distinguishes it from traditional editors, catering to the needs of developers who juggle various repositories.
- Aizen's open-source nature allows for community-driven improvements and customization, aligning with a tech-savvy mindset that values collaboration.
- Consider the benefits of having dedicated workspaces for each project, reducing distractions and enhancing focus, especially in a busy city environment.
- An alternative view might be that the learning curve for a new tool could initially slow down productivity, but the long-term benefits may outweigh this.
- The subscription model for Aizen Pro supports ongoing development, which can be viewed as a commitment to quality and innovation in software development.

## Worktrees. Terminal. Agents.

### Organize your repos

Group repositories into workspaces. Add repos, create worktrees for branches you're working on. Everything in one place.

### Switch worktrees, not windows

Each worktree has its own terminal, file browser, web browser, and chat session. Click to switch. Your context stays exactly where you left it.

### Work in parallel

Run agents on one branch while reviewing code on another. No stashing, no juggling windows. Just parallel work.

Start free, upgrade when you need more

Developers working on multiple branches typically juggle editor windows, terminal tabs, and browser windows. Aizen gives each worktree its own dedicated workspace — terminal, files, browser, agents — so you switch worktrees, not windows.

Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories. Unlike stashing or switching branches, each worktree is independent. You can build one branch while editing another.

### How is this different from VS Code or other editors?

Editors focus on one project at a time. Aizen is built around worktrees — you manage multiple repos and branches in one window, each with its own terminal, browser, and agent session. It's a workspace for parallel development, not an editor.

Aizen supports Claude, Codex (OpenAI), Gemini, Kimi, and any custom agent compatible with the Agent Client Protocol (ACP). Agents can be auto-installed from NPM or GitHub.

Yes! Aizen is fully free and open source under the GPL-3.0 license. All features — workspaces, worktrees, agents, terminal, file browser, web browser, voice input — are included for free.
