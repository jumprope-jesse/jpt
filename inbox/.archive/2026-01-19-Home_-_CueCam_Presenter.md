## Content (from Notion)

CueCam lets you bring content into your video calls without asking to share your screen.

It does this by giving your Mac a new  virtual camera   and  microphone   that you can use for video calls.

You get a  status bar menu   to share any picture, video, app window or connected camera with a click.

CueCam gives you the power of advanced live video software like  OBS   without any complicated configuration.

It connects with companion apps on your Apple devices. Use your iPhone as a camera and teleprompter with Shoot. Pick up an iPad and draw on anything with Video Pencil - it just works!

Smart scripts let you plan and run webcam-ready presentations (with a teleprompter, slides, videos and more) so all you have to do is look into the camera and be yourself.

# How could you use it?

### Teaching

Here's an intro to genetics that I put together in ten minutes using Chat GPT to plan a talk and bringing in some random images and videos from the internet.

### Presenting Your Work

Here's an example of how you might present some architectural designs to a client for sign-off.

This was another quick ChatGPT script and I generated a couple of "blueprints" with Dall-E.

I downloaded a random stock video walkthrough and made that the first card.

I copy-pasted the images over to Video Pencil on my iPad to make it easier to zoom in and annotate.

I was able to see my presenter notes on the iPad screen, as well as being able to navigate through my script using Video Pencil's on-screen CueCam remote controls.

### Sports Coaching

I don't know anything about football but here's how you could use CueCam for sports coaching.

I started with a clip of the team's game "from earlier". You probably have footage on your iPhone. I AirDropped this clip to Video Pencil to have more control on the iPad

I set up a trigger in CueCam to load and unload the video on the iPad

The next card shared a browser window and opened a YouTube link. Notice that you can hear the sound from YouTube.

I asked ChatGPT for an "inspirational speech" and put it on the next card.

There's some inspirational backing music to take it to the next level.

Finally, I used Live Titles in Video Pencil to add "Winners" onto the screen at the end.

### Sales Calls and Software Demos

Here's a demo of how you could use CueCam on a sales call.

I'd made a note about a comment my client made on the last call in the CRM and put it into my teleprompter so I didn't really have to remember their child's name

I had some language in the teleprompter to make sure I didn't forget anything.

When they asked a question I was able to quickly grab a video demo and drop it into the stream (I had actually recorded this demo moments earlier, directly to a card without leaving CueCam, but you could imagine building up your own library!)

I was able to seamlessly switch to a real screen share.

I followed through my notes to the end of the call to make sure I didn't forget to make a follow-up call.

# Testimonials

"CueCam Presenter elevates my game across the board. For example:

My recorded videos require fewer edits. I plan and produce them as structured, multi-camera shoots. I use the AI script assist to improve the coverage I give to any topic. I use my iPhone’s selfie camera as a production monitor and teleprompter. I telestrate on the iPad and share documents without them getting in the way.

The CueCam system has revolutionized my online sessions. I now watch meetings on my iPhone camera screen, so people see my eyes looking directly at them when I am listening and whenever I present something. Showing my screen (even sharing YouTube videos with sound) requires no special permission or meeting status. As a result, meetings have become more dynamic, spontaneous and enjoyable.

I am saving hours of planning and production time. I generate clip art and video using whatever AI tool du jour strikes me at the time. Maps and real-time simulations share easily, and incorporating snippets from PowerPoint, dashboards, and relevant web pages makes meetings take on a more meaningful tone.

Finally, how I provide tech support with never be the same. I can walk step-by-step through any process, sharing as I go. I look forward to providing these same tools to colleagues so they can explain themselves more directly as well!"
