# INTRAVIEW

## Overview (from Notion)
- Intraview enhances collaboration in coding, streamlining communication with your AI agent while you work in your IDE.
- It minimizes time lost in context-switching, allowing you to focus on your projects and family without disruption.
- The tool reflects the evolution of coding practices, where understanding and trust in technology are as important as coding speed.
- It empowers you to maintain a clear mental model of your work, which is crucial when juggling professional and personal responsibilities.
- Consider how integrating such tools can free up time for family activities or personal interests, enhancing work-life balance.
- An alternate view: reliance on AI tools could lead to over-dependence, potentially stifling creativity and problem-solving skills in the long run.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Intraview provides tools for AI agents to enhance collaboration by turning code into interactive walkthroughs, reducing the need for extensive reports and manual work. It allows users to follow step-by-step explanations directly in their IDE, maintaining context and improving understanding without switching tasks. The focus is on enhancing coding velocity through better collaboration rather than just faster code generation.

> Modern codebases evolve faster than our mental models can.Intraview give your AI Agent tools to help them keep you in sync — turning any code into collaborative walk-throughs you can explore and instrospect.

### BEFORE: Your Agent gives you homework

Your agent generates a ten-page report referencing scattered files and code snippets. You spend hours decoding what it means, hunting down references, and cross-checking for hallucinations. You find inconsistencies. You give up and redo the work manually.

Reading a v

Click through your agent's explanation step-by-step. Each step highlights the exact code it's referencing—inline, in your IDE. Give feedback in context. Maintain a clear mental model from start to finish.

No context-switching. No starting over. Just collaborative building.

Chat is designed for conversation. Intraview is designed for collaboration.

With Intraview, your Agent can show you step-by-step, with your actual code highlighted, without ever having to leave your IDE.

## The next big AI model release won't fix a broken workflow.

Coding velocity isn't how fast the machine can generate code and plans, it's about how fast you can understand, trust, and add your expertise. Get the critical collaboration layer that closes the gap.
