# Subway Builder

## Overview (from Notion)
- Urban Experience: The game simulates real-world transit challenges, mirroring your experiences navigating NYC's subway system.
- Strategic Planning: Develop skills in route optimization and resource management, valuable in both personal and professional settings.
- Family Impact: Engage with your kids in discussions about urban planning and public transport, fostering their interest in civic responsibility.
- Tech Innovation: As a software engineer, appreciate the game's use of data and algorithms, which could inspire your own projects or ventures.
- Community Engagement: Explore how these systems affect daily life, leading to discussions on public transport's role in sustainability and urban living.
- Alternative Views: Consider the balance between efficiency and community needs; not all commuters prioritize speed over accessibility or cost.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Subway Builder is a hyperrealistic transit simulation game where players design a subway system while managing real-world constraints and costs. The game simulates millions of commuters using data to optimize routes, station placements, and train frequencies for maximum ridership. Players must balance costs and efficiency, considering factors like wait times and overcrowding to enhance the commuting experience.

What is Subway Builder?

Subway Builder is a hyperrealistic transit simulation game. Build a new subway system from the ground up while dealing with real-world constraints and costs.

Features

Millions of commuters are generated from Census and Redistricter data and simulated using the same pathfinding algorithms you use. Your job is to design a route network that gets the most people to their destination as fast as possible. Juggle station placement, transfer dynamics, and train frequency to maximize ridership.

Build your system under realistic constraints and costs. Tunnels, viaducts, cut-and-cover, all have trade offs. Negotiate with real-world buildings foundations, geography and road layouts as you expand your network

Explore how individual commuters weight use various variables like wait times, transfers, income distribution, delays, and more, to pick their commute. Understand which routes, stations, and trains your commuters take and use that information to optimize your network.

Find the right balance between cost and time. Too many trains on a line or an overcrowded station will cause delays.
