In the rapidly advancing world of generative AI, most conversations revolve around foundation models — Claude, GPT-4, Amazon Titan, and others. But the true shift is happening not in the models themselves, but in how we use them — particularly when we combine reasoning, data retrieval, and autonomous decision-making into a single intelligent system.

This is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its evolution — Agentic RAG — come into play.

And when deployed on Amazon Bedrock, you get the best of both worlds: enterprise-grade infrastructure, model flexibility, and scalable orchestration. You’re not just building a chatbot — you’re creating autonomous digital agents that retrieve information, generate answers, and take meaningful action.

This article dives into what Agentic RAG is, how Amazon Bedrock supports it, and how you can implement it today in a real-world e-commerce customer support use case.

# What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique that enhances large language models (LLMs) by giving them access to external knowledge sources, such as internal documents, product manuals, or real-time data stores.

Instead of relying solely on the model’s training data, RAG works by:

1. Retrieving relevant content from a document store or vector database using semantic similarity…
