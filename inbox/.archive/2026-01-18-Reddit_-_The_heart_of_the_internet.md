Created a personal finance Apple Numbers Spread Sheet with Apple numbers input. It is a combination of my old personal finance spreadsheet income manager and apple shortcuts for input, but then added the charts from u/Own-Place6492 post a few months ago and revised their design. I made a video on YouTube showing how to set it up and how it works if you want to check it out: https://youtu.be/fAf8dRgQayY

Own-Place post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleNumbers/comments/1jx8fq4/personal_finance_dashboard_in_numbers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

The spread sheet is hosted at Payhip for free or pay what you want. I don't expect anything at all. If you like it and decide to use it, would love to hear from you on YouTube.

Most importantly, this is my first time making a big Apple Shortcuts project like this so if you know how to make it more efficient or convenient, I absolutely want to know. I wish there was a service where you can sort of hire a tutor/editor for stuff like this.
