## Content (from Notion)

Traditional GPTs rely on vector embeddings for knowledge retrieval, leading to limitations in storage and scope. Papr Memory offers a more robust retrieval system that transcends traditional storage and scope limitations. This allows for a single, secure data upload that's universally accessible across various GPTs and AI applications, simplifying the process for builders and enriching the experience for end-users.

### How does it work?

Papr Memory enables GPTs to perform actions like saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting personal memories for end-users. When a conversation begins, the GPT assesses whether to store or recall parts of the dialogue. The initial step involves authenticating the user. Once authentication is confirmed, the GPT proceeds to execute the appropriate memory action based on the user's input or needs.
