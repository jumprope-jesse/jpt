# This message does not exist | Mark J. Nelson

## Overview (from Notion)
- The notion of a message that "does not exist" reflects the ephemeral nature of digital communication; consider how often we interact with messages that are transient or deleted.
- As a software engineer, think about how this concept parallels software bugs or features that are planned but never implemented—ideas that seem real but ultimately don't materialize.
- The idea of discarding something that doesn’t exist challenges our understanding of value and meaning in communication; it prompts reflection on what truly deserves our attention and memory.
- Consider how this relates to parenting: the importance of teaching children about digital footprints in a world where messages and content can be temporary yet impactful.
- The philosophical angle invites you to think about existence and presence in both personal and professional contexts—how do we prioritize what we create and the digital legacies we leave?
- An alternate view could be that discarding an inexistent message symbolizes the futility of certain actions in tech—an analogy for evaluating what projects or ideas deserve your time and resources.
- The tension between existence and non-existence in digital spaces mirrors the challenges of maintaining work-life balance, where the "noise" of unimportant tasks can overshadow meaningful interactions.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
An intriguing notification reveals that a message cannot be saved because it does not exist, leading to ontological questions about existence and the implications of discarding such messages, which may still have accessible contents until discarded.

## Content (from Notion)

It can only be discarded

I received an intriguing notification in the Microsoft Outlook 365 web interface:

> This message can't be saved because it no longer exists. It can only be discarded. Make sure you copy the contents of the message before you discard if you want to use them later.

I have some ontological questions.

This message can't be saved because it no longer exists.

Sensible enough. Only messages that exist can be saved; an inexistent message cannot be saved. But what about that indexical, this? This message does not exist. Huh.

## * *

It can only be discarded.

We soon learn that we can do more than refer to a message that does not exist: we may also discard it. A message must exist to be saved; but it may be discarded without such a constraint. In fact this is the only thing we may do with it; it can only be discarded.

Perhaps this can be justified. Let's treat discard as the action of making an object cease to exist. Applying that action to an object that already does not exist can be considered a no-op. By contrast, any other action (save, say) requires the object to exist.

Make sure you copy the contents of the message before you discard if you want to use them later.

We learn a final affordance, which complicates the story. An inexistent message has contents, which may be copied – but only if the message has not yet been discarded.

This is troubling for our hypothesis that discarding an inexistent message is a no-op. A no-op from the perspective of its existence, perhaps – the message does not exist either before or after – but not, apparently, from the perspective of its contents. Undiscarded inexistent messages have contents that may be copied, while discarded inexistent messages do not.

The act of discarding a message that does not exist must therefore do one of two things. It may cause the message contents to also cease to exist. Alternately, it might not affect the existence but only the accessibility of message contents. Perhaps they continue to exist, but discarding the message (which already did not exist) causes the copy operation to cease being invokable on the message contents (even though they do continue to exist). The story of existence has many mysteries.
