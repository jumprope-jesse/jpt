Agentic AI systems, such as Claude Agent SDK (Claude Code) or ChatGPT Agents, can perform meaningful real-world tasks by operating computers, browsers, and phones just like humans. Open source would enhance their capabilities.

Open-Agent.io is an open Agentic AI you can use or modify. Chat with cutting-edge models while our multi-agent system completes your tasks.

Play with it, deploy it, enhance it, or use it as the foundation for your next dedicated agent. We welcome all contributions.
