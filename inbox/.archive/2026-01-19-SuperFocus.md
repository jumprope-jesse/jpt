## Content (from Notion)

We build practical enterprise products with large language model AIs (LLMs, like ChatGPT) to help companies and their people perform better and faster.

Our AIs are focused on internal company data, which we store securely in a separate “memory module” outside of the LLM, to stop hallucination.

We've tested our method on college textbooks. Our models answer questions from the textbooks with ~100% accuracy.

No hallucination.

Focused LLMs have many use cases as “co-pilots” in every industry. Any situation where large amounts of information must be reliably understood, summarized, analyzed, or acted upon.

## Corporate travel

Our co-pilot produces step by step instructions from the arcane rules and procedures of airlines, hotel, car rental, train, and travel platforms.
