## Content (from Notion)

Online media is fragmented. Your news, info, and updates come from countless sources. Blogs, microblogs, social networks, weather alerts, webcomics, earthquake warnings, photos, RSS feeds - it’s all out there in a million different places, and you’ve gotta cycle through countless different apps and websites to keep up.

It doesn’t have to be that way.

What if you had one app that gave an overview of nearly everything that was happening across all the different services you follow? A single chronological timeline of your most important social media services, RSS feeds, and other sources. All of the updates together in one place, in the order they’re posted, with no algorithm deciding what you should see or when you should see it.

That’s what we’d like to build.

With Project Tapestry, we'll create a universal, chronological timeline for iOS for any data that’s publicly available on the Internet. A service-independent overview of your social media and information landscape. Point the app toward your services and feeds, then scroll through everything all in one place to keep up-to-date and to see where you want to dive deeper. When you find something that you want to engage with or reply to, Tapestry will let you automatically open that post in the app of your choice and reply to it there. Tapestry isn’t meant to replace your favorite Mastodon app or RSS reader, but rather to complement them and help you figure out where you want to focus your attention.

Tapestry's universal timeline will be built around data source plug-ins. These are small bits of JavaScript code that translate between the native iOS app and the rest of the web. We'll supply a default set of plug-ins for a bunch of services and protocols, but if you like to dabble with programming, you'll be able to create your own using a simple API. Then that Raspberry Pi you built to check the level of the water tank in your garden can become a part of your universal timeline, too!

Our plan is to fund and then build Tapestry as an iOS app over the course of 9 to 12 months with the following features and functionality:

- 🕰️ Unified, chronological timeline
- 🔍 Detail view for individual posts
- 📙 Remember your reading position in the timeline
- 🌎 Ability to add common publicly accessible sources to your timeline, such as Mastodon accounts, RSS feeds, and more (see below)
- 🛠️ Basic support for building and adding your own plug-ins to support additional source types
- 📱 Support for iPhone and iPad
- 🗣️ Full accessibility via VoiceOver support
- 🆎 Support for dynamic font resizing
- 💡 Light and Dark theme
Want more?

The list above contains the basic features, but we all want Tapestry to do more! We know from experience that some things are surprisingly tricky or time consuming to build, so we don't want to promise more than we can deliver.

Now that we've exceeded the initial funding target (thank you!!!), we've put together some stretch goals to cover the development of more great features:

Our first stretch goal at $150,000 will be to add muffling and muting to the universal timeline as well as a mechanism to make it easy to share feed plugins created by others using our developer API. (estimated Q1 2025)

The second stretch goal is set to $175,000 and would allow us to spend the time and resources necessary to build more advanced filtering and search capabilities in the app as well as add bookmarking of feed items to make it easier to keep track of interesting things for later. (estimated Q2 2025)

The final big stretch goal of $250,000 is the one a lot of you have been waiting for: Native macOS support! To go along with that, we'd love to build an activity overview feature into the app to try to collate and summarize the most shared or more notable posts from the last day or so. (estimated Q4 2025)

Beyond these there are even more things we'd love to add if we can get the time and funding such as support for custom visual themes, local notifications, or a curated plugin library.

We'd love to have all of these features, of course, but we'll need your help to go above and beyond before we can get to them!

Who are we?

For over 25 years, the Iconfactory has made software beautiful. We craft icons, apps, and user experiences for clients large and small. We have a ton of experience building and maintaining our own apps, from Linea Sketch, our simple and fun sketchpad, to Twitterrific, our award-winning Twitter client that debuted on the App Store's first day.

The Project Tapestry team will include Craig Hockenberry and Sean Heber writing code, Gedeon Maheux, Dave Brasgalla, Talos Tsui, and Anthony Piraino doing design, and Cheryl Cicha as project manager.

You can help!

The team has already built a prototype and proved that the product idea is viable.

We're confident we can bring this app to life, but only if we have the time and money needed to do it. That's where you come in!

We have several pledge levels available with a bunch of great rewards and we hope you'll find one that works for you.

We're also offering a very special add-on: Personalized Pixel Portraits! We'll turn your smiling face into your very own retro, pixel-clicked avatar perfect for posting on your favorite social media service, printing and hanging on your wall, or sharing with your loved ones.

How about...?

There are some features no amount of money can buy, and some features that aren’t a good fit for this app.

For instance, we can only pull data from sources that are made publicly available. The good news is that there are plenty of sources that Project Tapestry WILL work with:

- ✅ Mastodon
- ✅ Tumblr
- ✅ Bluesky
- ✅ Micro.blog
- ✅ Any RSS Feed (blogs and news sources)
- ✅ USGS Earthquakes
- ✅ NOAA Satellite
- ✅ GO Comics
- ✅ And plenty more
Unfortunately, some popular services are walled off, and there’s nothing we can do about that. So, unless something changes, the app will NOT be able to pull in posts from:

- ❌ Facebook
- ❌ Instagram
- ❌ Threads
- ❌ Twitter / X
As for features, Tapestry will not be able to reply to or create posts on its own. The app is intended as an overview of your social media and information landscape, and functionality like creating content for any given service is better done from a dedicated app.

Make it so!

We hope you’re as excited about Project Tapestry as we are, and can’t wait to bring it to life with your help. It's important for us that this project is supported by the community. Social products that are funded with venture capital will eventually lose their way as they try to keep all of the investors happy. We do not want that for Tapestry.

Please help us spread the word about the campaign and follow us on Mastodon for the latest news about Project Tapestry. Thanks!

### Risks and challenges

The primary risk to the project is Apple's app review process. Since this is an iOS app, it will be subject to their review and approval, and it will be their decision whether or not to allow it in the App Store. However, we have successfully launched many apps and are aware of the limitations and restrictions. We will do everything possible to make sure the app passes review. Software development is always a challenge and time estimation is doubly so. We'll try to hit the target date, but there's always a chance (probably a good one) that it'll take a little longer than we thought. That said, the Iconfactory has an excellent reputation for shipping quality products and doing it on time.
