# A Chaotic Start - The New York Times

## Content (from Notion)

You’re reading The Morning newsletter. Make sense of the day’s news and ideas. David Leonhardt and Times journalists guide you through what’s happening — and why it matters.

Donald Trump has named most of the advisers and cabinet officials whom he wants to surround him in a second term. To make sense of the team, I asked for help from three of my colleagues who cover Trump: Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan. Our exchange follows.

David: I’ve talked with you three in the past about the likelihood that Trump’s second term would be more consequential than his first because his team would have more experience and more detailed plans. But does his list of cabinet selections make you wonder whether the second term may end up being almost as chaotic as the first? Pete Hegseth (the Fox News host Trump wants to run the Pentagon) and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (the pick for Health and Human Services) don’t have much experience operating a bureaucracy.

Maggie: There are some people with minimal government experience running large organizations in positions of power, so there will be a basic question about their preparation to oversee complex departments. But cabinet secretaries aren’t the only people who matter.

The team that Trump is putting in place, as deputies or chiefs of staff or senior advisers at agencies, are people who’ve proved some form of loyalty to him in other situations. All administrations do that to some degree. This version is much more sweeping.

Charlie: For all the chaos of Trump’s first term, he was occasionally constrained — by traditional Republicans in Congress and inside his own administration, by a federal judiciary he had not yet transformed and by career officials. All those constraints will be weaker this time.

An important thing is that Trump is planning to reinstate a change from the end of the first administration, one that the Biden administration rolled back. This change, known as Schedule F, would make it easier for cabinet officials to fire career civil servants and replace them with loyalists. So there is reason to believe that the second Trump administration will be more chaotic — but also that it will implement more of his agenda.

David: Some corporate executives have taken the selection of Scott Bessent, a prominent investor, as Treasury secretary to mean that Trump won’t enact policies that Wall Street dislikes, like tariffs and mass deportations. Is it?

Jonathan: I think economic policy will be influenced less by Bessent and more by how the markets respond to tariffs and mass deportations. The stock market is one of the few guardrails that might hold back Trump.

In his first term, Trump viewed the stock market almost like a poll, and he was anxious to avoid doing anything that would cause the S&P 500 to fall. Trump’s corporate-friendly advisers used this knowledge to manipulate him, telling him that if he went with maximalist tariffs, then markets would tank. C.E.O.s would use the same tactics to steer him away from some hard-line immigration policies.

Not too much has changed. Bessent is someone who has bought into much of the MAGA nationalist vision but who is also reassuring to Wall Street.

David: People often describe Trump as an isolationist, but he has named several hawkish people to his cabinet, like Marco Rubio at State and John Ratcliffe at the C.I.A. Should we expect the administration to engage more with the world than the word “isolationist” would suggest?

Jonathan: The Marco Rubio of 2024 is very different from the neoconservative version of Rubio that people remember from the pre-Trump era. He has gone a long way toward adopting Trump’s “America First” view. Ratcliffe is more hawkish than some others — in particular Trump’s dovish pick to be director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard — but he, too, bought into Trump’s worldview.

It’s also important to remember that Trump did not govern strictly as an isolationist in his first term. Yes, he withdrew the United States from some multilateral agreements and attacked a variety of global institutions. But he also presided over the Abraham Accords, the deal between Israel and Arab countries. He authorized missile strikes in Syria and ordered the assassination of Iran’s top general.

When he wanted to assert American power, Trump sometimes authorized a level of force that went beyond even what some military advisers thought was wise.

David: Cabinet selections often receive more attention, but White House aides can have more influence. What should we know about the White House team Trump has chosen?

Maggie: Trump likes having a lot of different competing subcenters of power, and he reminds them that he is the person whose view matters most. But he also likes watching people around him fight among each other, almost as if it’s a show.
