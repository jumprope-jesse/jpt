# Peer Programming with LLMs, For Senior+ Engineers

## Overview (from Notion)
- Peer programming with LLMs can enhance your coding efficiency, allowing more time for family and personal interests.
- The article emphasizes practical AI techniques that can be directly applied to daily engineering tasks, making your work more productive.
- Unique ideas include using LLMs for brainstorming and co-planning, which can inspire innovative approaches to project development.
- Documenting prompts is highlighted as a best practice, helping you refine your use of AI tools over time.
- Alternate views suggest that while LLMs can assist, they may not replace the nuanced understanding and creativity that human engineers bring to problem-solving.
- The reminder that LLMs are not as intelligent as they seem encourages a balanced perspective on their capabilities, promoting thoughtful and strategic use.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Exploring peer programming with LLMs reveals both challenges and benefits for senior engineers. Key resources include techniques for effective AI use in coding, workflows for code generation, and the importance of documenting prompts to enhance productivity. Remember to balance AI assistance with human input for best results.

Programming with LLMs is both promising and frustrating. While these AI assistants can help with coding and debugging, they often waste time too. Yet for senior engineers, pair peer programming with LLMs shows real potential.

This article is a collection of blog posts written by other senior or staff+ engineers exploring the use of LLM in their work, without the usual hype or buzzwords from the usual suspects. I hope you find them useful and inspiring.
