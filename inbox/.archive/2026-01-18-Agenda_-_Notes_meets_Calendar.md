See Agenda in action

Take Notes. Date Notes.

Agenda’s unique approach of organizing notes into a timeline helps to drive your projects forward. While other apps focus specifically on the past, present, or future, Agenda is the only note taking app that tracks them all at once, giving you the complete picture.

Take notes for what is currently on your agenda, while you prepare another for an upcoming meeting. Either by typing them or using the Apple Pencil on your iPad, your pick. Use older notes as breadcrumbs to remind yourself why you took the actions you did.

You can attach dates to individual notes, and even link them to events in your calendar. But you can also put them “On the Agenda”. Notes that are On the Agenda are given special status. You can search for them more easily, and they appear in a special group in the sidebar, so you can find them in a flash.

Agenda is currently available in English, Afrikaans, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese, with more languages underway.

Write in Style

The notes in Agenda are beautifully styled, and include powerful features like tags, links, tables, and lists. Agenda is a styled-text editor, combining the ease of plain text entry, with the visually stunning results of rich text.

Styles include headings, lists, indented blocks, and pre-formatted text. You focus on the meaning of your notes, and leave Agenda to handle the appearance. It results in documents that look fantastic, are consistent, and can be readily converted to formats like Markdown and HTML.

Agenda notes also work great to track tasks. There are different list styles — including checklists — and mixing in more extensive content is a no brainer, rather than an afterthought.

Due to its clean and crisp minimalistic design, Agenda allows you to focus on your notes, making them feel as if printed on paper.

Note-ally Organized

Notes appear in a project timeline, but projects themselves can also be grouped into categories. Notes are ordered in the timeline however you choose; you can drag them around, apply dates, or use a mixed approach. You can also collapse notes to save space.

Locating your notes couldn’t be simpler, with powerful search, a project jump bar, and related notes list. And when you find what you’re looking for, simply click back in the history to where you were.

Create smart overviews based on tags and saved searches to stay on top of everything going on in your busy life, and feel empowered as never before.

Plus, Agenda can give you access to the most relevant notes at any moment through widgets that you can add to your notification center or home screen.

Timely Reminders

To stay on top of all the things to do in your life, you can add a reminder to a task with one tap. It will automatically appear in Reminders app. Agenda presents your calendar events and due reminders in a single scrolling timeline. You'll never miss a thing anymore.

Reminders can be edited, rescheduled, or checked off without ever leaving Agenda. There are even shortcuts for power users: type in \remind(tomorrow), and Agenda will create a reminder scheduled for the next day, using the surrounding text to fill in the missing details.

Get Attached to Your Notes

Taking notes is not just about text. Often, you want to link to a web site, or include a file. If you are working on a journal, you might want to add a few photos; for a business meeting, it is very useful to be able to include a spreadsheet or presentation.

On iPad you can even literally draw your conclusions using an Apple pencil. Whatever it is you want to attach, Agenda has you covered.

You can easily link to web sites and files on your disk, but you can also drag files in to attach them. You can switch between four different ways to display an attachment, from thumbnail to full-width. Attachments get transferred between devices via iCloud or Dropbox, so you can view them wherever you are.

Using the powerful sharing-extension it is dead-simple to share your notes, images, or files from any app to Agenda. You can even edit your notes and add additional thoughts and comments as you share.

Take Notes Together

Agenda is the perfect personal note taking app, but some notes are meant to be shared with others. You can share anything from meeting notes to grocery lists and vacation planning, any note that makes sense for more than one person to see and edit.

Sharing a note in Agenda is simple and done in a secure way, your notes are fully encrypted on the device and while stored in the cloud.

Often when you work on shared projects and ideas, a lot of discussions take place on the topic in parallel. Thanks to the built-in support for “Shared with You”, Agenda fully integrates with the Messages app, making it easy to go from one to the other, while keeping your discussions in the Messages app and the content of your note in Agenda.

Many Devices, One Agenda

A note taking app is not very useful if you can’t share what you create. With Agenda, you can print and share notes, even whole projects, in standard formats like PDF, RTF and Markdown. You can also use the Agenda archive format to exchange exact duplicates of your notes with other Agenda users.

For power users Agenda comes with powerful automation features like templates, actions, and callback links. Turn Agenda into the central hub of your workflow, seamlessly integrating with the other apps you use.

Agenda is integrated with iCloud and Dropbox, so your notes are kept in sync across each of your Macs, iPhone and iPads. Add a note on one and within seconds it will appear on the others. Wherever you go, you always know what's “on the agenda”.

Best of all, your notes are kept in your personal iCloud and Dropbox, meaning neither us nor anyone else has access to them but you, because privacy matters.

Agenda is FREE, with no time limits. You can use it forever, at no cost.
