## AI Summary (from Notion)
Nonprofit organizations often misrepresent their purpose, leading to corruption and inefficiency, as seen in cases where funds meant for public good are mismanaged or used to lobby against affordable housing. This results in worsening social issues, such as homelessness, while executives profit from taxpayer money, highlighting a systemic failure in oversight and accountability in the nonprofit sector.

## Content (from Notion)

The act of naming is always a form of propaganda. When you name something, you are never perfectly describing what it is, but are instead influencing how it is perceived.

Marketers know this better than anyone. Prior to 1977, there was no such thing as the Chilean sea bass; the fish was called, instead, the Patagonian toothfish. The Chilean sea bass isn’t a type of bass at all, and most of them do not come from Chile. It was purely a marketing invention: an entrepreneur named Lee Lantz intuited that the American market might enjoy the taste of the Patagonian toothfish, but would never buy it under its given name. First, he chose to falsely call it a “bass” because Americans were comfortable with that type of fish. He then rejected the names “Pacific sea bass” and “South American sea bass,” on the grounds that they were too generic, and eventually settled on “Chilean sea bass” as a more exotic alternative.

The name of one of the most popular fish in the world therefore has nothing to do with what the fish really is. A type of cod that is primarily farmed near Antarctica became the Chilean sea bass as a Goldilocks branding compromise. The familiarity of the bass was married to the perceived exoticism of Chile so that an American entrepreneur could sell a fish nobody had ever heard of to high-end restaurants in the United States. This ploy worked so well that today nobody has ever heard of the Patagonian toothfish, while the Chilean sea bass has a secure and inalienable position on restaurant menus from sea to shining sea.

So its name is propaganda, but nobody cares. A lie that makes money will always be preferable to a truth that does not. Once you realize that every name is propaganda, it becomes readily apparent how much misconduct, greed, and corruption can be concealed behind an innocuously disingenuous name, especially a name that successfully evokes positive emotions in the general public.

Consider the word “nonprofit.” Whoever came up with the idea of calling these organizations “nonprofits” was a marketing genius on the level of Steve Jobs. When someone hears the word nonprofit, they assume that such an organization is working for the public good; that it serves the homeless, protects the weak, exists for the benefit and the betterment of society at large. Hearing that something is a “nonprofit” immediately gives a sense that the organization is trustworthy and the people running it are driven by a charitable agenda. It’s a word that shuts down the critical faculties and grants an instantaneous moral stature to any organization to which it is applied. Consequently, nonprofits receive a benefit of the doubt that would not be granted to any other form of private corporation.

Yet nonprofit organizations are frequently the exact opposite of what they appear to be. As a consequence of the benefit of the doubt provided to nonprofits, there is rarely enough oversight to guarantee that they are doing what we pay them to do. In some cities, upwards of a billion dollars of public funds are paid to nonprofit organizations every year with glaringly insufficient safeguards to ensure that the money is used in a manner likely to serve the public interest.

This money is then spent in ways that would shock the taxpayers whose hard-earned dollars are being effectively stolen from them. Nonprofits that self-righteously declare themselves providers of homeless services actively lobby to make homelessness worse in order to increase their own funding; nonprofit organizations hire convicted felons—including murderers, gang leaders, sex offenders, and rapists—who go on to commit more felonies while receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in government contracts; and the executives of nonprofits, the very people in charge of institutions whose stated purpose is not to make money, earn millions of dollars while catastrophically failing to deliver the public services we are paying them to provide.

And as all of that is going on, the nonprofits in question receive tax breaks from the IRS, ensuring that the incompetent organizations worsening your city’s homelessness crisis exert their corrupting influence all the way to the halls of power in Washington, D.C.

### Money for Nothing

There is a notorious nonprofit in San Francisco called the Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, or todco for short. The Tenants and Owners Development Corporation, despite containing the word “development” in its name, has not developed a single property in approximately twenty years. More and more, todco isn’t spending its money to help its current tenants, either. The San Francisco Standard found that todco’s spending on resident services declined from 62 percent of revenue in 2012 to only 45 percent eight years later. The Standard interviewed tenants in one of todco’s buildings and was deluged with complaints about decaying accommodations and rodent infestations. A woman told them bluntly that there were rats in the walls and complaints to management went nowhere; the tap water tasted foul and she sometimes found roaches in her food. One man felt a bite on his neck and assumed at first that he’d been bitten by one of the multitude of vermin that crawled through the building’s light fixtures; in fact, he’d been accidentally shot and the bullet hole was still visible in his wall when reporters interviewed him several months after the fact.

It turned out that instead of spending money on housing development and tenant support, todco boosted executive pay and funneled millions into lobbying. As todco’s spending on its tenants declined by 17 percentage points, executive pay quadrupled. Meanwhile, todco’s president, John Elberling, launched the Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, a political lobbying organization. Between 2012 and 2020, todco’s direct lobbying of legislative bodies increased 95 times, from $5,000 to $470,000. The Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium spent another $1.35 million on ballot referenda between 2016 and 2021, and within the small pond of municipal politics, that much money, if strategically deployed, can buy a shocking amount of influence.

Here’s where the story gets strange. Although todco’s nonprofit status is predicated on helping poor people afford housing, todco lobbies incessantly to prevent the construction of affordable units in some of San Francisco’s most expensive neighborhoods. In 2018, todco sued to prevent the construction of a mixed-use building on the grounds that it would cast “new shadows” on a community garden; todco then agreed to drop this lawsuit after the building’s developer paid them $98,000, raising questions as to whether todco was merely using San Francisco’s byzantine permitting process to extract a bribe from another developer. In another case, todco lobbied to block a 495-unit housing development that would have included over a hundred affordable units. In other words, an affordable housing nonprofit has repeatedly sued other developers to prevent the construction of the same affordable units that it is supposed to be working to provide.

And then, in July of 2020, the strangest of todco’s fiascos took place. That year, todco prevented the construction of over one thousand new apartments, including 350 affordable units, so it could run a “racial equity study,” which it then never bothered to conduct. San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston—a todco political ally—convinced the land use committee to put off the development for six months, during which time todco would supposedly analyze the development’s impact on minority residents in the neighborhood.

By August 2022, todco had not even begun the study that was supposed to have been completed eighteen months earlier. When asked by reporters from the San Francisco Chronicle why the study had never been done, todco’s president told the Chronicle that Covid interfered with their plans and a consulting group they’d been relying on had dropped out. Both of these excuses are highly dubious. When todco lobbied to delay the housing development so it could run its mythic study, Covid had already been rampaging through the United States for six months, meaning that todco was not blindsided by Covid and cannot use it as an excuse for failure. Furthermore, one consulting group dropping out should not indefinitely delay a study when the organization running it has millions of dollars in annual revenue, tens of millions of dollars in total assets, and a bevy of political connections. If todco wanted to run the study they could have done so, but they have exhibited no sense of urgency despite the fact that their failure to conduct the promised study has indefinitely prevented the existence of 350 units of affordable housing.

Todco is a nonprofit whose mandate is to provide affordable housing. Over the last twenty years, however, todco has produced no additional units of affordable housing, has allowed the units it already owns to decay, and has spent millions of dollars preventing other developers from building thousands of apartments and hundreds of affordable units. Paradoxically, a nonprofit meant to provide affordable housing is spending taxpayer money to prevent affordable housing from being built; an organization that exists with the explicit mandate to help alleviate San Francisco’s housing crisis is instead working tirelessly to make that crisis worse. How can this be explained?

To understand todco’s behavior, you need to know something about the business model of affordable housing nonprofits. An affordable housing NGO makes more money as rents rise in the area where its buildings are located. Government subsidies make up the difference between what the NGO’s tenants are paying and what they could be paying if the building charged them the market rate. This means that a nonprofit, despite its name, has the same profit incentive as any other landlord, in that a lack of housing construction increases its profit margins by driving up rents. The only difference is that a nonprofit benefits from high rents through government subsidies instead of from directly charging its tenants.

And that is an obvious conflict of interest. Nonprofit housing providers benefit financially if less housing gets built because high rents increase their subsidies. Affordable housing nonprofits are therefore incentivized to work against housing affordability if they want to increase the amount their executives get paid. Everything todco is doing is a natural consequence of the nonprofit industrial complex. Todco’s subsidies rise in concert with rents; it then funnels the money it receives from the government back into lobbying the same politicians responsible for funding it; those politicians prevent the construction of housing on todco’s behalf, thereby ensuring that rents remain high and todco rakes in millions of additional dollars in government subsidies; and todco’s executives receive enormous boosts to personal compensation and buy million-dollar houses in the suburbs. It is a kickback scheme so ingenious it would make Al Capone green with envy.

This propensity for nonprofits to privilege their own finances over the needs of the poor is not unique to San Francisco. Last year, an initiative to establish a public social housing developer in Seattle was opposed by the Housing Development Consortium, a lobbying organization for affordable housing nonprofits. The Seattle Times’ reporting on this initiative is revealing:

> The Housing Development Consortium, a lobbying group whose members include King County’s major low-income housing developers, financial institutions and governmental development agencies, doesn’t want to compete with a new organization for funding.

In other words, a lobbying organization for affordable housing nonprofits advocated against a social housing initiative on the grounds that it would direct funds away from its members. Many of the people involved in these affordable housing nonprofits would describe themselves as socialists, and yet they argued against a more socialist form of public housing development and in favor of the privatized, complex, and inefficient system that just so happens to financially benefit themselves.

In the event that America tried to dramatically increase the amount of public housing, a policy advocated by many progressives, it is likely that some of the fiercest opponents would be nonprofit landlords who would be outraged at the prospect of direct competition from government-owned housing. This is normal behavior for a private organization that relies on the government as its primary revenue source, but it is directly contrary to what the term “nonprofit” would seem to imply. Despite their trustworthy name, nonprofits are not now—nor have they ever been—the uncorrupted agents of the public good that their defenders would have us believe.

### Crime Inc.

Exacerbating the profound conflicts of interest created by outsourcing government services to private nonprofits is the near total lack of oversight of these nonprofits, particularly with respect to how their money is spent and whom they hire to provide their services. It is a regular occurrence that money given to nonprofits is misdirected in a way ruinously contrary to the public interest. In especially egregious cases, money given to nonprofits finds its way into the pockets of people who never would have been hired by a government agency due to either a lack of competence or a disqualifying criminal history.

For instance, San Francisco gave tens of millions of dollars to a nonprofit called the United Council of Human Services over the course of two decades; their CEO proceeded to spend large sums of money in a totally illegal manner, buying at least five vehicles for herself and family members and driving around with a trunk full of expensive jewelry. She also allowed twenty of her friends, family, and employees to occupy government-subsidized apartments which were meant to be used as housing for low-income San Franciscans.

There is always going to be some level of malfeasance when large sums of money are involved, but what makes the United Council’s criminality inexcusable is that Gwendolyn Westbrook, the CEO who stole taxpayer dollars and spent them on herself, pleaded guilty in 1997 to stealing thousands of dollars in parking lot collections while working for the Port of San Francisco. A nonprofit run by a woman with a proven history of stealing from government agencies was given tens of millions of dollars to provide affordable housing services, and San Francisco’s political class was somehow surprised when, true to her previous track record, she stole that money, too.

Following Westbrook’s fall from grace, a San Francisco Standard investigation discovered that the city had paid tens of millions of dollars to nonprofits that were ineligible for government funding: $25 million went to charities that were either delinquent or suspended and another $65 million went to nonprofits that were later declared ineligible. At the time of the Standard’s investigation, San Francisco had another $300 million of future contractual obligations to NGOs it was not legally allowed to fund.

Although San Francisco is one of the worst cities when it comes to nonprofits behaving badly, these same problems exist in every city that makes excessive use of the nonprofit sector. Seattle, in particular, has a rather distressing tendency to give exorbitant sums of taxpayer money to convicted felons, up to and including violent criminals and registered sex offenders. In 2001, a man named Khalid Adams was convicted of first degree theft in an incident in which he allegedly groped his victim while shouting racial slurs; two years later Adams was convicted again, this time of first degree robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm. Adams’s third—but not final—conviction came in 2021 when he pled guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon.

Only a year after Adams’s third conviction, however, he was hired to work as a “violence interrupter” by a government-funded Seattle-area nonprofit called Community Passageways. In November 2022, while receiving a salary from King County taxpayers to prevent gun violence, Adams broke into his ex-girlfriend’s apartment, held her new boyfriend at gunpoint, and was subsequently shot by the ex’s eighteen-year-old cousin. Adding a surreal element to this already incredible story, Savior Wheeler, the young cousin who shot Khalid Adams, was a client of Community Passageways, one of the same at-risk young people that Adams was supposed to keep away from gun violence. A Seattle nonprofit therefore hired a three-time convicted felon who was fresh out of prison to work as a mentor for at-risk youths, and he was subsequently shot by one of those very at-risk youths while threatening an ex-girlfriend at gunpoint.

This is a surprisingly common occurrence in Seattle. In 2022, the city gave $260,000 dollars to a registered sex offender who was operating under a fake name and credentials to mentor at-risk young people. In 2020, they gave a $3 million no-bid contract—one of the largest grants in city history—to a nonprofit called Freedom Project to run a “racial equity study.” Freedom Project’s executive director at the time was David Heppard who was convicted as a teenager for taking part in the gang rape of a pregnant seventeen-year-old. Freedom Project’s finance director, Quddafi Howell, once shot up a man’s house as an intimidation tactic to prevent him from snitching on Howell’s drug dealing.

Believe it or not, the $3 million Seattle handed over to a bunch of convicted felons was somehow mismanaged. A local political blog called Seattle City Council Insight looked into the paperwork behind this contract and discovered that hundreds of thousands of dollars were handed out to subcontractors for minimal work and the project’s lead was paid $300 per hour while publicly claiming to be a volunteer.

In another case, a homelessness nonprofit called share (the Seattle Housing and Resource Effort) turned out to employ an unlicensed accountant at the same time they were handling millions of dollars in government funds. Share claimed that they were the victim in this case, as they were unknowingly defrauded by a man who held himself out as a legitimate accountant. Fair enough. Share, however, might have noticed that their accountant was unlicensed were it not for the fact that share’s treasurer, the man presumably responsible for handling all their money, was Lantz Rowland, an unqualified homeless man who lived in a tent. This nonprofit had total annual revenue of approximately a million dollars in 2016, which included grants from King County and the City of Seattle, and the people responsible for handling that money were an illegal accountant and a sixty-year-old homeless tent dweller with no discernible qualifications.

Leaving the West Coast for a moment, one finds similar outcomes arising from the overuse of nonprofits in the Windy City. In Chicago, an anti-violence nonprofit called CeaseFire has had a shocking number of its “violence interrupters” arrested for serious crimes since its inception. This ought to surprise nobody given that these “violence interrupters” are almost universally convicted felons. Ceasefire workers convicted of crimes while employed by the organization include a fifty-one-year-old arrested for illegal gun possession, whom authorities alleged was also moonlighting as a national gang leader; a convicted felon caught naked under his bed with $50,000, an illegal firearm, crack cocaine, and heroin; and a woman who was hired despite four prior felony convictions and subsequently stole $10,000 worth of diamonds.

Chicago also has a state-funded “Peacekeepers” program in which “community-based organizations” deploy former convicts to act as violence interrupters during times when tensions are expected to be high. Last Memorial Day, a “Peacekeeper” named Oscar Montes assaulted a motorist while on duty, leaving the man with potentially permanent eye damage. Montes was hired by the Peacekeepers program only a year after serving a ten-year prison sentence for shooting a rival gang member.

What is instantly noticeable about the above examples is that none of these people could draw a government paycheck unless it was laundered through a nonprofit. A police department could never hire a convicted felon with long-term ties to street gangs, but a private nonprofit has looser standards regarding who is allowed access to public funds. This not only squanders money on people who are not capable of performing the roles they’re assigned, but is an active threat to public safety in circumstances where the state uses convict-staffed nonprofits for duties that ought to be reserved for the police.

### The Progressive Doom Loop

At the start of this piece, I said that “the act of naming is a form of propaganda,” an aphorism which applies to nonprofits because the name they’ve been given is a marketing device, rather than an objective representation of their conduct and behavior. It’s important to recognize, though, that nonprofits aren’t the only group relevant to this story that has been given an inaccurate name as a marketing ploy. The political ideology that supports the nonprofit industrial complex is generally referred to as “progressivism,” which calls to mind the socialist-leaning Progressive movement of the early twentieth century. In spite of sharing a common name, however, today’s “progressivism” has nothing in common with the Progressive movements of the last century, is not socialist in any real sense, and is, if anything, an extremist libertarian movement that destroys the ability of the government to function, rather than using state power for the betterment of the poor.

Once you start digging into the evidence, you find that the places where “progressives” wield the most power are some of the least socialist governments in the country. In 2022, San Francisco spent $5.8 billion on private contracts, over 40 percent of all city government spending, while the entire budget of Houston, a city 2.5 times as large, was only $5.7 billion. It is a strange form of socialism that runs more than two-fifths of its government through private contractors, instead of using publicly owned developers and social housing.

Portland, Oregon, meanwhile, has been suffering from a serious trash crisis for the past several years, due both to the city’s soaring homeless population and the government’s refusal to enforce antidumping laws. Portland’s response to the festering trash piles now blighting a once-beautiful city has not been to dramatically increase the government’s capacity to pick up and process garbage; instead, Portland, in conjunction with the state of Oregon, has paid millions of dollars to nonprofits to deal with the trash problem.

As Portland outsourced trash collection to private nonprofit organizations, the ability of the government to collect trash has been gutted by budget cuts and a lack of resources. According to local activist Frank Moscow, Portland used to sweep every street as a matter of course, but currently only has one functioning street sweeper in the entire city. Not that it matters much, since Portland’s Bureau of Transportation suspended all street sweeping activities last June after another series of budget cuts.

Adding to Portland’s trash-addled misery is the city’s inability to stop anyone from dumping their trash where it is not legally allowed to do so. In 2016, the city issued thirty-one citations for illegal dumping; in 2021, they issued a grand total of one citation, for a measly $154. An opinion column published in the Oregonian in 2022 asserted confidently that “you could dump 10 large bags of garbage in Pioneer Square tonight and drive off without fear of being caught or penalized,” before going on to complain that Portland picks up trash from residential units every two weeks, instead of offering weekly trash pickup like almost every other city of comparable size.

This is the state of affairs in almost every city where “progressives” have a large impact on local politics. Progressives claim to support government spending programs, but also have an anarchistic, anti-governmental attitude that can be seen in their support for policies like police abolition in 2020. Although progressives want the government to fund public programs, their opposition to centralized state power means they often don’t want the government to run the programs being funded.

The cities progressives control therefore tend to underfund core government agencies in favor of “community-based organizations,” by which they mean NGOs and nonprofits. Once the government can no longer meet its responsibilities, progressive cities outsource those services to nonprofit organizations, effectively privatizing the government.

A serious problem then occurs. Using several nonprofits instead of one government agency is inherently inefficient due to weak oversight and an inability to take advantage of economies of scale. That’s why cities on the West Coast spend so much on homelessness to no end whatsoever. San Francisco’s spending on homeless services increased from $200 million in 2016 to an astronomical $1.1 billion in 2021. Despite this incredible investment, on an average night there were a thousand more homeless San Franciscans in 2022 than there were in 2015. In fairness, there was a decline in the city’s homeless population between 2019 and 2022, leading the deputy director at the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing to declare that “investment works.” Yet San Francisco’s population fell by seventy thousand residents between 2019 and 2022, meaning the miniscule reduction in homelessness was likely a mere by-product of massive population loss.

Nor are the problems that cities like San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle have with falling population unrelated. By funding inefficient nonprofits instead of more centralized, accountable government initiatives, progressive cities have high taxes but poor services; residents receive nothing in return for the taxes they pay. Portland has one of the highest municipal income tax burdens in the country, but is forty-eighth out of the fifty largest cities in police staffing, has piles of festering, uncollected garbage littering its streets, and only has two thousand shelter beds for a homeless population of 6,300, requiring four thousand homeless Portlanders to sleep outside even if every one of them wanted a bed.

Contrary to the conservative assumption that high taxes are an inherent evil, people are often fine with higher taxes provided that the taxes are utilized to improve local living standards. What is taking place in America’s most performatively socialist urban areas is that taxes are constantly raised in order to fund public services, resulting in some of the most heavily taxed populations in the country. But this tax revenue is then squandered on private contracts to unaccountable nonprofit organizations whose activities do little to rectify the problems they are nominally being funded to address.

Taxes soar in concert with the collapse in local living standards and the decay in public services. Public parks where children used to play fill up with homeless drug addicts who leave used needles near jungle gyms; a six-year-old girl in California mistook a syringe for a thermometer and put it in her mouth, and an eleven-year-old stepped on a needle while swimming in Santa Cruz. The streets grow increasingly unsanitary due to spiraling homelessness, reintroducing diseases once considered eradicated by civilized living. Los Angeles had three deaths from flea-borne typhus in 2022, the first such deaths in three decades; a reverend who works on Skid Row lost both legs to an infection he contracted simply walking the neighborhood’s streets; and Portland’s Old Town recently experienced an outbreak of Shigella, a disease mostly seen in developing countries that spreads through fecal matter.

The inability of nonprofits to properly manage services results in European taxes for third-world state capacity. Residents don’t know what the problem is: they don’t know that their taxes go to “violence interrupters” who are convicted felons; they don’t know affordable housing nonprofits use taxpayer money to lobby against affordable housing; and they don’t know money is being misallocated due to insufficient oversight of nonprofits.

All they know is they pay high taxes for no reason. And so they leave. Oregon’s largest county lost 2.5 percent of its population between 2020 and 2022. As the population declines, the tax base shrinks. San Francisco’s sales tax revenue fell 22 percent between 2019 and 2022, with the worst decline seen downtown, where office buildings now have record-high vacancy rates.

Many articles have been written recently about the threat such cities face of an “urban doom loop,” in which a falling population guts tax revenue, which forces cuts to city services, thus reducing livability and causing an accelerating population exodus in a vicious cycle. To my knowledge, however, nobody has ever argued that a major contributor to this death spiral is outsourcing government services to unaccountable nonprofit organizations, rather than increasing state capacity and improving the government’s ability to solve problems itself. In this contrarian narrative, American cities are not failing because they’re too socialist; they’re failing because they aren’t socialist enough.

And that, alas, is the state of the great American city in the early twenty-first century, where nothing is as it seems. Ours is a country where “progressivism” has nothing in common with the movement from which it takes its name; where “socialists” privatize government services at every opportunity; and where countless “nonprofits” exist solely for the misbegotten profit of the people who run them. Again and again, the names we use to explain the realities of modern urban politics are propagandistic marketing terms and not an accurate representation of what is taking place.

Just like with the invention of the Chilean Sea Bass, however—which is neither Chilean nor a bass—many people are making money off the scheme. Who cares if it’s all a lie?

Americans are familiar with steep political divisions on issues like race, class, and gender. Perhaps less understood, but arguably more definitive, is the widening gap between the cognitive elites concentrated in big cities and the rest of the country. In our current “war against the masses,” to quote the late Fred Siegel, geography plays an increasingly dominant role.

Even as people move away from big cities and head to suburban, exurban, and rural areas, progressive geography insists that the nonurban majority lives in racist hellholes that produce leaders like the odious Donald Trump. These areas also supposedly serve as breeding grounds for Trumpian fascism, as the Nation recently suggested.

Disdain for the people inhabiting the periphery has long been embedded in the media and academic worldview, dating back even before the writings of Lewis Mumford. It is also ultimately terrible politics. Demeaning non-city dwellers as racists, homophobes, and fascists may not be the best way to start a conversation with the roughly 90 percent of Americans who live outside the urban core.

### Urban Progressive Rage

Perhaps the most noxious—and widely discussed—assault on how Americans choose to live can be seen in White Rural Rage. Written by two progressives, University of Maryland professor Tom Schaller and veteran journalist Paul Waldman, the book’s basic thesis is that the American countryside has become a breeding ground for every reactionary tendency, from assaults on transgender “rights” to racism, authoritarianism, and the latest bugaboo, Christian nationalism.

The authors base much of their thesis on the “abandoning of rural and small-town America, particularly among the young.” In reality, however, rural and small-town America turned the corner several years back, and now these areas are growing faster than they have in a half century. Demographer Wendell Cox has found, through census data analysis, that migration out of small towns and cities began dropping in 2016. Since 2020, they have started gaining net migrants while big metro regions with over ten million residents have lost 1.5 million migrants since 2010, a decline that has now spread to regions with over 2.5 million.

Schaller and Waldman link this decline to the rise of far-right, violent politics and identify rural and small towns as the “essential source” of anti-Democratic Trumpism. But as a recent piece in Reason demonstrates, the research cited by Schaller and Waldman concludes the opposite: the “more rural the county, the lower the county rate of sending insurrectionists” to the January 6 Capitol riot. The authors of the Reason piece also mention a peer-reviewed article in the journal Political Behavior that compared rural and non-rural beliefs and found that rural Americans are actually less supportive of political violence than people in bigger cities. In discussing political violence, Schaller and Waldman, not surprisingly, do not mention the deeds of Antifa or the massive and sometimes deadly disruptions during the 2020 Floyd riots.

The authors also claim that commitment to democracy and free expression in rural America is “faltering.” An Atlantic study, however, recently showed that the most “intolerant” precincts in America are located not in the countryside but in urban regions, led by the Boston area, the Bay Area, and the Puget Sound, while rural areas were far less so. Similarly, the strongest opposition to free speech and support for censorship and de-platforming comes not from the South or the Great Plains, but from highly educated college graduates, particularly from the most elite schools such as Harvard. A recent Rasmussen poll notes that inner-city elites, with graduate degrees from prestigious institutions and an oversized media imprint, feel Americans have “too much freedom,” while the vast majority believe there is not enough.

And then comes the inevitable charge in White Rural Rage that this part of the population is “uniquely xenophobic.” Yet in research I led for Heartland Forward, we found some of the fastest growth among foreign-born Americans is occurring in places like Des Moines or Cedar Rapids. Brookings has noted that, although they tend to oppose undocumented immigration, denizens in these areas have experienced the fastest growth in foreign-born population nationwide. Moreover, this surge has taken place in strongly pro-Trump places that traditionally experience low concentrations of immigrants. Whereas the overall growth was 10 percent nationally, the growth in states like Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, and the Dakotas during the last decade stood at 30 percent.

Many newcomers I interviewed do not find hostility in small towns and rural areas. They instead find a supportive community; these newcomers are a welcome addition to regions that have long seen an exodus of talented young people. “I can’t say I experience racism here as an immigrant,” remarked architect and Springfield, Missouri, resident Angela Shyaka, who is 24 and of mixed Polish and Rwandan ancestry. “It’s a great place to settle because it is very welcoming, and people are supportive. The dynamic I see here is very encouraging. I would rate it high.”

### Urban Illusions, Suburban Dreams

The other critical target of the new progressive geography is the suburbs and exurbs. In Disillusioned: Five Families and the Unraveling of America’s Suburbs, author and Philadelphia resident Benjamin Herold sees the suburbs as reflecting a flawed and “relentless cycle of radicalized development and decline.” He portrays the suburbs as providing only “an illusion of wealth” perpetuated by government handouts and fundamentally “a Ponzi scheme” with awful ramifications for communities and families.

For generations, progressives and urban boosters have predicted the death of suburbs, arguing that they will become “the next slums.” Takedowns of suburbia are regular features in progressive papers like the New York Times, which also blame them for city housing woes. Yet the suburbs are hardly dying. Indeed, they account for about 90 per cent of all growth in U.S. metropolitan areas since 2010. Between 2010 and 2020, the suburbs and exurbs of the major metropolitan areas gained two million net domestic migrants, while the urban core counties lost 2.7 million people.

The same goes for businesses as investment in corporate real estate moves away from dense urban areas. Remote work, rising before the pandemic but expanding rapidly since, allows professionals to work ever further away from their place of employment. According to a recent MIT study, suburban and exurban lifestyles, which are built around cars, now constitute roughly 80 percent of the nation’s metropolitan population, while barely 8 percent live in the urban core and the rest in traditional transit-oriented suburbs.

Much of this growth comes from millennials, a generation once widely seen as preferring urban life; two-thirds of that generation, even before the pandemic, favored suburbs as their preferred residence. A massive “back to the city movement,” the meme heard incessantly in places like Herold’s Philadelphia, does not seem to be in the cards. A Los Angeles Times/Reality Check Insights national poll taken after the November 2020 election found that just 44 percent of respondents would pick a big city once again; 32 percent of big city dwellers state that they would definitely move away from big cities if they could. This is notably greater than the quarter of those who live in suburbs and small cities who feel the same way.

Perhaps the biggest counterfactual lies in the changing ethnic dynamic in the suburbs. Rather than epitomizing racist white flight as Herold suggests, suburbs are where integration is taking place. In the fifty largest U.S. metro areas, 44 percent of residents live in racially and ethnically diverse suburbs in which nonwhites make up between 20 and 60 percent of the population. Over the past decade, non-Hispanic whites accounted for less than 4 percent of growth in suburbs and exurbs, while Latinos accounted for nearly half, and Asians, African-Americans, mixed raced, and other groups made up the rest. Meanwhile, elite urban regions like the San Francisco Bay Area have become ever-more segregated.

In their rush to view everything through a racial lens, Herold and other progressive geographers seem to miss reality. Most minorities and immigrants are likely to move to the periphery, away from places like Philadelphia, for the same reasons others do, such as good schools, parks, and safety. These ethnic suburbanites, tend to be largely ignored in progressive geography. After all, they do not fulfill the racial stereotypes so cleverly lampooned in the recent film American Fiction. Blacks who leave the city, as Pete Saunders and Ed Zotti note in a recent Chicago-area study, are not headed to other central cities but primarily to the affordable suburbs of the South.

To be sure, Herold correctly addresses some suburban problems, like the rise of crime and deterioration of schools in some areas. Nevertheless, crime, both violent and property-oriented, is currently about 50 percent higher in urban areas (it is even lower in rural areas). In terms of schooling, the story is much the same. Suburban schools may not be as strong as in the past, but the gap between them and urban public schools remains as strong, or even stronger, than ever in terms of graduation rates and performance.

### Who Is the Settler Here?

Rather than deal with suburbs or rural areas as places of aspiration, some progressive geographers endorse a version of the “neocolonial” settler meme used by the activist Left. In this approach, people who live in an area, even one that has deteriorated, need to be protected from even well meaning attempts at uplift. In Sixty Miles Upriver, a chronicle of gentrification in the Hudson River town of Newburgh, New York, Richard Ocejo identifies everyone by race first and views everything else through that prism. The poor in the town of twenty-eight thousand, which is 25 percent black, are simply victims of “racialized poverty” threatened by the presence of mostly “white” settlers, who found a place “like Brooklyn only affordable.”

Yet Ocejo concedes that gentrification has opened opportunities for Latinos, now almost half the city’s population. Latinos do not easily fit into the progressive schema of “people of color” because they have no great historical tie to the place and, like many of the white gentrifiers, they tend to be entrepreneurial in outlook. Nor is this a small phenomenon; the Hispanic population in the county of Orange, New York, has grown over 30 percent in the past decade.

So, who’s the settler here? Ethnic and population shifts are not merely the product of some nefarious power and land grab at the expense of hapless minorities, undertaken by what the author labels a “racial hierarchy”; 2024 is not 1904 or even 1970. For all the tensions in our society, racial integration and intermarriage are actually increasing, just not in core cities which are increasingly characterized by a bifurcation between wealthy professionals and the large underclass.

### Ill-Intentioned Identitarians

The progressive obsession with race and past transgressions characterizes Chhaya Kolavalli’s Well-Intentioned Whiteness. This book attacks well-meaning attempts to create urban gardens in Kansas City as an assault on “people of color.” Gentrifiers, for all their good intensions, may put pressure on rents in neighborhoods, but they also provide opportunities in largely stagnant neighborhood economies. Instead, Kolavalli argues that victims of gentrification are also victims of “settler colonialism,” a term much in vogue among progressive writers.

Kolavalli depicts African Americans not as potential beneficiaries of an improved city, but as permanent victims of unrelenting “whiteness.” Yet, as in many regions, Kansas City’s African Americans are taking matters into their own hands. In fact, they have become more integrated as they head to the periphery, notes a recent report from the Kansas City Star. For instance, suburban Wyandotte County, across the river in Kansas, is over 20 percent black and 31 percent Latino.

It’s doubtful these people are migrating to get away from garden gentrifiers or from attempts to beautify the city. Instead, reasons like poor education, rising crime, and a lack of better jobs surely play a role; they are, however, largely ignored in the book. Well-Intentioned White ness ends up embracing the notion of handing out parcels in the city to nonprofit “community land trusts,” a particularly bizarre assertion given her employment at the Kauffmann Foundation, once a fount of studies backing entrepreneurship.

However skewed these approaches may be in terms of realities, the progressive geographers should not be dismissed as impotent. If President Biden is reelected, some of these approaches will continue to shape federal policy beyond just the blue states. We could see attempts to invest even more in transit systems which now serve a tiny part of the general population, as well as restrictions on single-family homes and new peripheral communities, as we already see in California.

But ultimately these efforts will fail as people continue to move to geographies not approved by our cognitive elites but more congenial to people’s aspirations. Until progressives reconcile themselves to the preferences of the vast majority, they will continue to struggle, screaming in the Manhattan night while the rest of America seeks a better life in the broad expanses of this enormous country.
