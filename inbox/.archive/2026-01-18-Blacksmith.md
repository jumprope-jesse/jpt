Blacksmith is an easy win at any scale. Save money from day 1 and go faster. A rare technical product with no downside

Ted Nyman

Co-founder & CEO of Cased

ex-CTO of GitHub

Blacksmith is amazing! With unlimited concurrency at half the cost, switching from Github Actions is pure upside. Their team's quick and helpful support on slack is the cherry on top.

Luke Zeller

Product & Engineering at Pallet

Blacksmith offered lower cost and faster runners and made it easy to switch and see if those claims were true. Not only were those claims true, they continued to deliver more value with better observability for our CI/CD pipelines. That's allowed us to optimize our build pipelines so we can ship more, faster.

Nick Crohn

Staff Software Engineer at Sibi

Switching to Blacksmith was a game-changer for us. We cut our GitHub Actions costs in half and saw noticeably faster runs thanks to their newer hardware and custom actions. Their wizard made the whole process super easy — I was up and running in no time and service has been rock solid!

Fernando Battistella

DevOps Engineer at Finch

We switched from GitHub-hosted runners to Blacksmith and saw

decreased build times because of their better machines and caching.

Our CI costs were also cut by half.

Gautam Gupta

Co-Founder at Highbeam

Blacksmith is a no-brainer if you're using GitHub Actions. It took less than 10 mins to integrate and cut our CI time by 35% and our CI costs by 70%.

Greg Bergé

Product Engineer at GitBook

Blacksmith has been great for our developer velocity - it’s much faster than GitHub runners so our team spends much less time waiting for code to build.

Advith Chelikani

Co-Founder at Pylon

Switching to Blacksmith was a quick one-line change and we saw an immediate 30% improvement in CI time. It was a noticeable upgrade and made it fun to push commit-by-commit again

Gabriel P Samson

Founding Engineer at Slope

Since switching to Blacksmith, our build times are over 65% faster, our costs have gone down and our engineers are more productive.

We couldn't be happier!
