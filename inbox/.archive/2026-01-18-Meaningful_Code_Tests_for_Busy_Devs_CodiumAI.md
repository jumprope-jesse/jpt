This is a really great tool. Sometimes it makes the whole work for you, other times it needs some guidance, but it definitely makes your life easier with unit testing.

It has been very helpful and easy to use. It has improved my writing of code and explains code very well.

When it comes to tests design and suggestions, this is by far one of the best solutions/integrations nowadays.

Have tried a bunch of code assistant, CodiumAI is by far the most predictable, dependable and customizable plugin of all!!

Codium is awesome and has been impacting positively in my work. I strong recommend using this tool for productivity.

It’s been fantastic to use CodiumAI—one of my favorite plugins on VSCode. The best feature, for me, is the auto-generated tests.

Super intuitive ! Simplify the tedious tasks so we can focus on coding.

I use this plugin daily and I can’t think of any other plugin that speeds up my coding so much all while retaining high quality. Even bigger leap forward than Copilot.

What a great tool !!! I improved my development time by 2x at least.

It’s incredible to write docs and tests, two very boring tasks. And almost plug and play, not many configurations :)

However, I couldn’t set up to run the tests on my pipenv environment (maybe It has been my fault)

Even though I have limited experience writing tests, I know that it is an essential, although slightly tedious, task. CodiumAI changes this and makes testing fun! I like that it caters to many frameworks, e.g., Vitest, Mocha, Jasmine, and more. The code suggestions are the cherry on top, though, I love it!

The future is here. This gives more in-depth code reviews than many humans. It also comes up with test cases I would not have thought of and catches edge case bugs.

Just started to use CodiumAI, and fell in love. The test option, suggestions, and detail about the code, etc are very good.

Testing a function and codes may need to adjust some parameters to get the desired result, but yes it is still a lot more to go.

Kudos to all the teams for this fantastic add-on.

As a developer who spends countless hours coding, I’m always looking for tools that can enhance my productivity and workflow.

CodiumAI is a game-changer for me. Even though it’s not perfect, it boosts productivity a lot!

One of the best extensions, it makes life easier by generating unit tests automatically, Integrates smoothly with VSCode, and assists in enhancing the quality of your code. Amazingly good !!

Once in a while, you encounter a tool that radically improves your productivity.

CodiumAI may just have joined the ranks of tools like Storybook and Gherkin for me in reducing my work-load while improving its output quality.

Amazing extension!

Any newer dev that starts using this is going to be so far ahead of their competition”

Jack Forge Founder @FiveSurge

“Optimistic and inspired. Just tried the @CodiumAI tool today, and I think it is the first true 10x dev tool. I find it far more utilitarian than co-pilot.”

Travis Full Stack Web Developer @Travis_codez

“I think a big portion of my shock was that I thought the tests were going to be just some random templates that didn’t do much. I didn’t think it would generate so many and they actually be detailed.”

Danny Thompson @DThompsonDev

“I have already used @CodiumAI and would be glad to recommend it to the community to give a try ✔️”

This is the best superpower AI tool for Developers. This tool can enables busy devs to create meaningful tests for Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript code.

Review from

The software development I knew is now gone forever.

Last week, I started testing @CodiumAI's Visual Studio Code plugin to propose and generate unit tests for my code. I'm never going back.

I'm now 10x faster, and my code is much better.

## CodiumAI isn't perfect

You should always double-check the tests CodiumAI generates

AI and ML have come a long way, but they're far from perfect. So while CodiumAI helps you break fewer things and be more productive, it needs your help to do so. That's why we designed it to be interactive – so you can edit the tests it generates and perfect them.
