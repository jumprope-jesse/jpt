r/programminghumor - Meeting Driven Development

 Programming can be a challenging yet rewarding field, and developers often find humor in their shared struggles and experiences. Here are some of the most relatable programming memes and sentiments from Redditors that capture the essence of a developer's life:  
•   Code Still Standing: Many developers relate to the struggle of keeping their code functional and not turning into a "skeleton." "Your code is still upright and is not a skeleton. Teach me your ways."  
•   Simplicity Over Complexity: There's a shared desire for code that is simplified and not overly complicated, especially if it's functional. "Not only that, but appears to be simplified and not overly complicated; if it’s functional I’d take it."  
•   Offline Functionality: The wish for code that works offline is a common sentiment among developers. "Shit. I wish my code was that good and could work offline."    
•   CS vs. Math Jobs: Many computer science graduates find jobs more easily compared to those in mathematics. "I don't know, everyone who graduated computer science with me has a job, but people that graduated in math dont."  
•   Quick Job Offers: Graduating with a CS degree often leads to quick job offers. "Im in the same boat, the second I got my undergrad in CS I was instantly offered a job and been doing well, same with all my CS friends."  
•   IT Job Market: The IT field is seen as more forgiving for unemployment. "You're unemployed for 5 minutes or less in IT. Not so easy with math."    
•   Senior Dev Tactics: Senior developers often cover for juniors while subtly passing on the tough tasks. "I want the juniors to become seniors and stay long enough to have Stockholm syndrome. Then I will pass on all the shitty senior dev tasks to them."  
•   Covering for Mistakes: Many junior developers appreciate senior devs who cover for their mistakes. "Shoutout and BIG THANK YOU to all awesome Sr Devs out there covering our asses when we truly fuck up."  
•   Protecting Juniors: Senior developers often protect juniors from client and management pressure. "On Friday I said to her 'your only worry is to focus on getting this done, let me handle the client and our boss.'"    
•   Love-Hate Relationship with Tools: Developers often use complex, messy tools like ffmpeg because they work, despite their flaws. "Yeah, its a horrible horrible mess, but literally everyone fucking uses it and it works."  
•   Debugging Nightmares: Debugging complex issues in widely used tools can be a nightmare. ["I once been debugging weird desync where chunked video slowly accumulated audio offset. It took me hours to “guess” the issue (welcome to the world of ffmpeg)..."](https://www.reddit.com
