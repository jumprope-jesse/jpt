The AI multi-tool for text

Simple daily notes for a complicated world

### 1. Write stuff down.

Type or talk. Plain text, no formatting, no organizing, no fuss.

### 2. Grug connects the dots.

Names, dates, companies auto-link; phone numbers, emails, and other attributes get extracted and filed where they belong.

### 3. Get answers.

Ask things like "Who do I know in tech that surfs?" or "What's on my training schedule for Monday?" If it's in your notes, Grug tells you.

Pro tip: Start with daily notes. Just dump everything there. The system figures out where it belongs. No folders, no categories, no decisions.

Chat, with your notes as context. Plan anything.

Review every edit. Get multiple perspectives. Use AI like a pro.

See exactly what AI changed. Accept or reject individual edits with visual before/after comparison.

Grug Notes is a product from Kamanu Composites. Yes, we make canoes. We design them, build them from scratch, and sell them directly to customers. We do everything in-house to a fault — including building our own software since 2008. In 2020, we made 900,000 face shields and stayed organized with Roam Research. We learned a lot about scale, note-taking, and life.

After that, we knew what we wanted: the organization without the overhead. The linking without the learning curve. Notes that work when you're on the shop floor. So, in October 2022, we put a text box on a website, and Grug Notes was born. We march forward, always keeping simplicity at our core and our roots in manufacturing in our hearts.
