## Content (from Notion)

AWS App Studio, a generative AI–powered app-building service that uses natural language to build enterprise-grade applications, is now generally available. App Studio helps technical professionals (such as IT project managers, data engineers, enterprise architects, and solution architects) build intelligent, secure, and scalable applications without requiring deep software development skills. App Studio handles deployments, operations, and maintenance, allowing users to focus on solving business challenges and boosting productivity.

App Studio is the fastest and easiest way to build enterprise-grade applications. Getting started is simple. Users describe the application they need in natural language, and App Studio’s generative AI–powered assistant creates an application with a multipage UI, a data model, and business logic. Builders can easily modify applications using natural language, or with App Studio’s visual canvas. They can also enhance their applications with generative AI using built-in components to generate content, summarize information, and analyze files. Applications can connect to existing data using built-in connectors for AWS (such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3) and Salesforce, and also hundreds of third-party services (such as HubSpot, Jira, Twilio, and Zendesk) using an API connector. Users can customize the look and feel of their applications to align with brand guidelines by selecting their logo and company color palette. With App Studio it’s free to build—you only pay for the time employees spend using the published applications, saving up to 80% compared to other comparable offerings.

App Studio is generally available in the following AWS Regions: US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland).
