## Content (from Notion)

I uploaded 11 years (97k Hours of transcribed audio, and over 3k days of entries) of my Day One Journal data yesterday to OpenAI's GPT-4o. Last night at the dinner table with my wife and two children, we then explored the depths of "Dad so far;" I can confidently say last night was one of the best experiences of my life. Why I grew up without a father and have lived my life so far in search of validation, approval, and acceptance; Olivia and Noah will never have to wonder what I think about them, which is such a wild concept. How different will they show up in the world from a place of abundance instead of inadequacy? Of course, I express my feelings to my children, but the way they interacted with GPT-4o was different—it was like they were asking questions that I feel we wait until someone is no longer with us to ponder. Noah asked, using the context of my dad's journal; to tell me about the things he says most about me, and in milliseconds, there was a perfectly structured answer, first summarized and then placed in categories. I also asked it to write a poem about my life Threads of Resilience In the tapestry of life, threads intertwine, A journey of resilience, a story so fine. From the shadows of struggle, where darkness crept, To the dawn of new days, where promises were kept. In childhood’s fleeting years, a nomad’s path was tread, Homeless and shifting, where uncertainty spread. Yet from these trials, strength was born, In the heart of the storm, a spirit reborn. A father now, with love so deep, For Olivia and Noah, dreams to keep. Creative and impulsive, reflections of me, In their laughter and wonder, I see what could be. Lauren, my partner, through thick and thin, In moments of challenge, we find ways to win. Intimacy and connection, a bond so strong, Together we navigate where hearts belong. In work and growth, ambitions rise, Through trials and efforts, we reach for the skies. A mind restless, with ideas that flow, Harnessing ADHD’s gift, in patterns I know. Reflection and mindfulness, practices dear, In journals and moments, truths become clear. From past shadows of shame, I strive to be free, Forgiveness and growth, in the light I see. Family and friends, a community tight, In their support, I find my light. From moments of joy to times of strife, They weave into the fabric of my life. Resilience and grit, in every thread, A story of survival, where hope is fed. In the dance of life, I find my way, Balancing ambition with gratitude each day. The journey continues, with lessons learned, In the fire of experience, strength is earned. With love as my guide and dreams in sight, I navigate the path, towards the light. --- I'll take it from here I write this post, tears from my eyes, finally finding love for who I am inside. As we embrace disruptive technological change, My wish for all, that we pursue, a more beautiful humanity, not just a more productive one.
