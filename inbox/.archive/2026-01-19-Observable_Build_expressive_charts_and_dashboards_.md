### Developers at the world’s leading companies choose Observable’s end-to-end platform to build and share data apps, dashboards, and reports.

## Develop and deploy data apps the modern way

The open source Observable Framework uses a file-based workflow. Code in your preferred editor and check everything into git. You can even develop and preview offline.

Read the Framework docs

Load and transform your data in Python, SQL, R, and more. Then tap into the full capabilities of the browser to display data with JavaScript in the client. It’s the best of all worlds.

Slow queries and timeouts are the bane of dashboard viewers. Observable takes snapshots of data during build so dashboards load instantly. Say goodbye to spinners.

### Continuous deployment

Bring CI/CD to your dashboards and data apps. Test before you ship, use automatic deploy-on-commit, and ensure displays of data are always up-to-date. Self-manage scheduled builds and deploy to Observable or self-host.

## Purpose-built for data apps

Observable is a single place for all your data work — from hosting polished dashboards to ad hoc data exploration in live notebooks. We take care of SSO, workspace management, audit logs, and more, so you can focus on creating better data apps.
