# Unlost - Recall anything instantly with zero effort

## Overview (from Notion)
- Simplifies information retrieval, saving time and reducing cognitive load—ideal for juggling parenting and work.
- Enhances productivity with effortless search capabilities, allowing quick access to important details without disrupting workflow.
- Utilizes local data processing for privacy, which aligns with concerns about data security in today’s digital age.
- The ability to exclude certain apps or websites is beneficial for maintaining focus, especially in a busy New York City environment.
- Unique feature of capturing screen context intelligently, which can help in recalling details from meetings or projects without extensive note-taking.
- Alternative view: Some may prefer traditional note-taking or digital tools that require more active engagement, believing it enhances retention.
- Could be seen as a potential crutch for memory, leading to a reliance on technology rather than developing one's own cognitive skills.
