## AI Summary (from Notion)
Context engineering is emerging as a preferred term over prompt engineering, emphasizing the importance of providing comprehensive context for tasks to be effectively solved by language models. Influential figures like Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke and Andrej Karpathy support this terminology, highlighting the complexity and artistry involved in filling the context window with relevant information for optimal performance in LLM applications.

The term context engineering has recently started to gain traction as a better alternative to prompt engineering. I like it. I think this one may have sticking power.

Here's an example tweet from Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke:

I've spoken favorably of prompt engineering in the past - I hoped that term could capture the inherent complexity of constructing reliable prompts. Unfortunately, most people's inferred definition is that it's a laughably pretentious term for typing things into a chatbot!

It turns out that inferred definitions are the ones that stick. I think the inferred definition of "context engineering" is likely to be much closer to the intended meaning.
