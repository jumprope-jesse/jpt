"The families in our neighborhood are all on the Tin Can network. Now our 6-10 year olds are calling each other, setting up their own social time, and running from house to house as they go from one play date to another. We are so happy to be building community and delaying the demand for smartphones!"

"Tin Can gives younger kids the freedom to call their friends without asking an adult to use their cell phone and getting distracted by games or apps. They can make plans on their own, have conversations vs. face time just watching each other do something. Tin Can is just like the good ol days! Basic is best!"

"We got Tin Can phones for our 7 and 9 year old a nd couldn't be happier with the purchase! They work perfectly. My daughter calls her out-of-state grandparents nearly daily. Both kids have friends whose Tin Cans are on their way, and I cannot wait to see them make plans on their own and just generally socialize the old school way!"

"Tin Can has been such a fun and positive addition to our household! My kids love the independence it gives them to connect with their friends or our extended family on their own. I also feel better knowing that my kids have the Tin Can when we leave them home alone. Knowing they can reliably contact us or even 911 if necessary gives me more peace of mind."

"Having Tin Can has been an incredible experience for my family. My daughter loves being able to independently connect with her friends to make plans or just chat. Her ability to connect with grandparents has been a huge benefit too allowing her to schedule her own sleepovers thanks to Tin Can granting her phone freedom. My family has absolutely loved having it."

"We love Tin Can! Our 9 year old no longer asks about getting a cell phone because she can now connect with her friends and grandparents whenever she wants. And it’s been a great learning opportunity for both kids, teaching them how to answer the phone, take a message, and have a phone conversation. We also appreciate the peace of mind knowing they can call us, 911, or a grandparent."
