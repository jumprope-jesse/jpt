# Thoughts on (Amazonian) Leadership

## Overview (from Notion)
- Amazon's leadership principles can offer insights into effective management and innovation, relevant for your role as a software engineer and founder.
- Customer Obsession: Balancing customer needs with innovative solutions can fuel product development—don't just build what they ask for, but anticipate their future needs.
- Ownership: Emphasizing long-term vision can help in creating a sustainable business model. Collaborating with the tech community can enhance your offerings.
- Bias for Action: While speed is important, maintaining high standards is crucial. This can build trust with your customers, especially in the fast-paced NYC market.
- Consider how Amazon’s siloed structure might inform your approach to team dynamics—fostering open communication can lead to better collaboration.
- Alternate view: Some might argue that prioritizing speed can sometimes lead to burnout; finding a balance between action and reflection is key.
- Explore how these principles can apply not just in business but also in parenting—fostering ownership and responsibility in your kids can lead to better decision-making in their lives.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Amazon's Leadership Principles, while often criticized, provide sensible guidelines for running a company. Key principles include Customer Obsession, which should focus on understanding true customer needs rather than just requests; Ownership, which should extend beyond individual teams to the broader technological ecosystem; and Bias for Action, which emphasizes speed but must not compromise quality or customer trust. The author suggests that Amazon should enhance collaboration and transparency to truly embody these principles and maintain customer confidence.

Amazon's Leadership Principles are famous, not just within Amazon but also in the tech world at large. While they're frequently mocked — including by Amazonians — they're also generally sensible rules by which to run a company. I've been an Amazon customer for over 25 years and an AWS customer for almost 20 years, and also an AWS Hero for 6 years, and while I've never worked for Amazon I feel that I've seen behind the curtain enough to offer some commentary on a few of these principles.

- Customer Obsession: Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.  Customer Obsession is great, but I often see Amazonians taking this too simplistically: "Start with the customer" doesn't have to mean "ask customers what they want and then give them faster horses". In the early days of AWS I saw a lot of what I call "cool engineering driven" products: When EC2 launched, it wasn't really clear what people would do with it, but it was very cool and it was clear that it could be a big deal in some form, sooner or later. Some time around 2012, the culture in AWS seemed to shift from "provide cool building blocks" to "build what customers are asking for" and in my view this was a step in the wrong direction (mind you, not nearly as much as the ca. 2020 shift to "build what analysts are asking for in quarterly earnings calls").
- Ownership: Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that's not my job."  This principle is both too narrow, and not being fulfilled, in my view. It's not enough to simply act on behalf of the entire company: It's important to act on behalf of the entire technological ecosystem. Some Amazonians are great at this — I recently commited patches to FreeBSD's bhyve because an Amazonian was putting together a standard for interrupt handling in large VMs, and even though Amazon doesn't make any use of bhyve (at least, I don't think it does!) he understood the importance of getting standards widely accepted across the entire virtualization space rather than narrowly in the code Amazon relied upon. There's a saying in computer security, that anything which makes one of us less secure makes all of us less secure: Attackers will leverage an exploit against one system to allow them to attack another system. While the same does not directly apply in other fields, working with others to produce the best results for everyone will be much better in the long-term than focusing solely on what Amazon needs right now.
- Bias for Action: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.  Amazonians talk about "one-way doors" and "two-way doors", and it is quite true that many decisions are can be reversed... but that doesn't always mean that there is no cost associated with reversing a decision. There is a clear and widely recognized tension between "Bias for Action" and another principle, "Insist on the Highest Standards"; but there is also a tension between this and earning and keeping customer trust. When AWS ships a service which is half-baked, it diminishes customer trust in AWS as a whole; even if the problems in that service ultimately get corrected (either by fixing them or in some cases by simply getting rid of a service which should never have existed in the first place) the memory of a failed launch will live on in customers' minds for years to come.
Werner Vogels famously said in his 2024 re:Invent keynote, "Listen to the AWS Heroes". I think he was talking about technical advice, and perhaps speaking mainly to AWS customers; but I like to think that Amazon might also benefit listening to some of what I've said here. We criticize because we care.
