# Lapdev

Self-hosted remote development enviroment management with ease

Lapdev is a self hosted application that spins up remote development environments on your own servers or clouds. It scales from a single machine in the corner to a global fleet of servers. It uses Devcontainer open specification for defining your development environment as code. If you’re interested in a deep dive into how Lapdev works, you can read about its architecture here.

## Planned Features

- More workspace types: Currently Lapdev only supports container based workspaces, which has its own limitations for example when you want to run a k8s cluster in your development flow. It's planned to have support for more than containers. VMs and bare metal machine support are on the roadmap. And more OS support is planned as well, e.g. when you are developing a cross platform desktop application for Windows, Linux and macOS, Lapdev can spin up development environments on all of them and you can develop and debug from the same local machine without the need to switch machines.
