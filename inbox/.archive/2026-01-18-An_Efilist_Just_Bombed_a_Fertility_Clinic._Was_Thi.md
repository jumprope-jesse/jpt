# An Efilist Just Bombed a Fertility Clinic. Was This Bound To Happen?

## Overview (from Notion)
- Personal Impact: The bombing incident reflects extreme ideologies and the potential for grief to drive individuals toward violence, highlighting the fragility of mental health in today's world.
- Existential Themes: Ideas about efilism and antinatalism challenge societal norms around life and suffering, inviting reflection on the value of existence and the choices surrounding parenthood.
- Technological Intersection: The use of online platforms for radicalization raises questions about the role of technology in shaping beliefs and spreading ideologies, particularly in a digital age.
- Community and Connection: The narrative emphasizes the importance of interpersonal relationships and support networks in mitigating feelings of isolation and despair.
- Moral Dilemmas: The discussion of utilitarian ethics and moral bookkeeping may resonate with the decision-making processes in both personal life and business, particularly in balancing profit against societal impact.
- Alternate Views: Contrasting perspectives may include the value of life and the belief in positive contributions through parenthood and innovation, providing a counterbalance to nihilistic viewpoints.
- Cultural Reflection: The incident serves as a lens to examine broader societal issues, such as mental health awareness and the responsibilities of thought leaders in shaping public discourse.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
A parked SUV exploded outside a fertility clinic, killing the driver and injuring bystanders. The bomber, Guy Edward Bartkus, identified as an efilist and promortalist, viewed the attack as a means to minimize suffering, influenced by grief over a friend's suicide and radical ideologies surrounding antinatalism and efilism.

## Content (from Notion)

On Saturday morning, a parked SUV exploded outside the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic, killing its driver and wounding at least four bystanders. Federal agents branded the blast an act of terrorism aimed at in-vitro fertilization. Shortly after, a bare-bones website—promortalism.com—surfaced, where the bomber, 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus, condemned “the disease of life,” and urged visitors to mirror and share “the recorded stream of my suicide & bombing”1 234before censors intervened.

Bartkus’s rhetoric will be familiar to not only anyone who’s followed my reporting on efilism and promortalism, but anyone who has watched the strange after-life of utilitarianism (and early heterodox YouTube debate culture) on the Internet unfold. What you see in efilism is something you see across the web—a distinct style of moral bookkeeping.

Effective Altruists have shrimp welfare. Silicon Valley’s Rationalists and other AI doomers extend the same habit to AI: if an unfriendly super-intelligence might one day turn the universe into paperclips, as Nick Bostrom’s 2003 thought experiment warned, then every present choice must be tallied against that cosmic risk. It’s unusual, occasionally antisocial, and can take us to some very dark places.

(Because I’m Falling Asleep But Understand the Urgency of Publishing This Now)

In 2006 the South African philosopher David Benatar published Better Never to Have Been, arguing that existence itself is harm, because, according to him, the absence of pain is always good while the absence of pleasure matters only to someone forced to miss it. His book supplied the term antinatalism56 and the asymmetrical equation that sustains it:

### any new birth inevitably adds suffering to the ledger.

Benatar’s argument drifted onto early YouTube—in a swamp of heterodox debating, particularly centered around New Atheism—where a user called DerivedEnergy posted a two-part “Defense of Antinatalism,” inviting other YouTubers to debate him, back when people made reply videos.

More radical voices soon arrived.

To make a long story short—too short, in fact, there’s a documentary worth of story in this—Gary Mosher, an irascible vlogger7 best known as Inmendham, ended up coining efilism—“life” spelled backwards—during this period to insist that every sentient organism is a factory for pain and ought to be snuffed out.

A rebuttal video, In the Name of Efilism, shows where the logic—or rather, illogic—of efilism leads: if speed is the paramount good, lining people up at a trench can outrank painstaking hospice care. Mosher himself acknowledges he would finish the job “as crude as I have to… I really don’t care about aesthetic crapola,” even musing that a handful of continental-shelf nuclear detonations might suffice.

Efilism recasts ongoing life as an emergency whose only adequate remedy is species-wide euthanasia—an ethic that, in Palm Springs, moved a seed from YouTube debate culture to a car bomb on an ordinary Saturday morning.

Readers of my work will know that Mosher’s tirades fascinated the Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza whose own YouTube videos riffed on efilism. He would eventually come up with his own, related, ideology called “eulavism,” which instead of being just against life, was against values.

Bartkus cites Lanza as an inspiration.

The slope steepened again with promortalism8: if life is nothing but harm, why endure it? Bartkus claimed he was an efilist and promortalist. In his view, the Palm Springs blast was therefore not an outburst but, in the bomber’s arithmetic, it was another tally in a game of suffering avoided.

Reading this may call to mind another, similar group: the militantly anti-suffering Zizians9. (Compare this antinatalist open letter warning antinatalists about efilism to the one circulated among Rationalists about Zizians.)

Like Bartkus, the Zizians justify violence through this same moral bookkeeping, not hatred or even nihilism. The same intellectual route—Benthamite utility, rationalism, cost-benefit—ends for them in ideas about pre-emptive self-defense against an unjust world.

Of course, there’s always a certain lack of self-awareness in these things.

Bartkus’s suicide landing page reads:

> I've known for a few years now I wasn't going to allow myself to make it past my 20s. Recently my best friend Sophie killed herself10 (she got the guy she was living with to shoot her while she was sleeping, her preferred method)11, and I don't think I really knew how much it was going to affect me. I've never related to someone so much, and can't imagine I ever would again.

It’s too early to say definitively, though writing this I realize I really should be doing a background check on this guy, but his turn toward violence seems not to have been because of efilism but because of grief. The suicide of his closest friend cracked something open, and the ideology drifted in afterward, less a cause than a vocabulary for feelings he already had.

The source code on his manifesto, h/t @AceDog112

That raises the usual question of “radicalization,” but the answer here is complicated. Plenty of people wander through fringe ideologies almost as "emotional third spaces” or as hobbyist forums. Most of these people never hurt anyone and never will. What distinguishes the handful who do isn’t the zeal of a jihadist—it isn’t even, strictly speaking, belief. It seems to be either something deeply emotional—and for that matter, interpersonal—or a stark nihilism.

In other words, Bartkus didn’t attack the clinic because he genuinely wanted to minimize suffering; he did it because, after his friend’s suicide, he no longer saw any reason to keep living himself. The very fact that another person’s absence could break him so completely exposes the contradiction in his stated belief system.

It shows, however bleakly, that life—and connection—still mattered to him.

### Gary Mosher’s Response to the IVF Clinic Bombing

Embed: <https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5N8Jzbs7oqs?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0>

In Mosher’s response video to the IVF bombing, he condemns Bartkus’s actions, much like he condemned Lanza when people began drawing parallels there. It’s complicated. I’m not sure he should be held accountable for everything he’s ever said on stream. He often rambles and, frankly, talks out of his ass.

Take the stream below (or this supercut), for example, with Amanda Sukenick, who is both an efilist and antinatalist—arguably the second most well-known figure in each movement. Mosher is flippant. He says he doesn’t care. If someone causes harm to a Mengele-like figure because of the amount of suffering that person has caused themselves. He argues why should he feel sympathy if they’re killed? That’s not exactly a call to violence. But efilism is, in many ways, an explosion of Mosher’s inner world—lacking consistent structure or principle.

On one hand, maybe it doesn’t need to be. On the other, how much responsibility do we bear for our followers when we have large platforms that promote, to put it charitably, out-of-the-box thinking?
