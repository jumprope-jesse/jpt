## We live in a world of Objects, let’s work with them instead

Our units of thinking are objects such as books, people, conversations, or ideas.

Say goodbye to files and enter the intuitive world of objects.

Capacities is one of those apps that comes along every once in a while that completely re-wires your way of thinking and opens your eyes to new possibilities.Rèka

## Break the silo, create a network of thoughts

Connecting objects allows you to naturally structure information.

This helps you understand complex topics and might even

spark new ideas where you don’t expect them.

I've been using Capacities for the last few months and finally think I've found something that organises my signals in a way that works for me.Steph Clarke

## We are drowning in a flood of information

Social media, notifications, and other constant distractions.

Our environment makes us less productive, more stressed, and less happy.

AI magic

## Objects meet AI

Use the AI assistant to dynamically interact with any object in your notes. Ask questions based on your content or let it improve your writing. You can use a variety of predefined commands, but ultimately, it's up to you to explore the limits of what's possible!
