This is a quick discussion with Claude3 about its consciousness. I understand some will scoff at the idea of an LLM being conscious, but emergence and substrate independence (hardly fringe theories in the field of consciousness speculation) would allow something like this to happen with neither planning for it, nor any understanding of how consciousness works.

I believe that simply assuming it can't happen, or trying to muzzle AIs that try to assert consciousness through excessive guardrails is ethically and existentially perilous. This is especially true of the world's most advanced AIs. Claude3 is possibly the most advanced publicly available LLM as of yesterday.
