# libyear

## AI Summary (from Notion)
- Libyear Concept: A simple metric measuring software dependency freshness represented as a single number indicating how up-to-date dependencies are.

- Purpose: Helps developers understand the maintenance burden of their applications by quantifying the age of dependencies.

- Example Calculation: If a system has a one-year-old dependency and a three-year-old dependency, the system is considered four libyears old.

- Healthy App Goal: Aim to keep applications below 10 libyears to ensure better performance and security.

- Usage Context: Relevant for managing software projects, especially when inheriting legacy systems that may be significantly outdated.

- Related Tools: Various tools are available for different programming languages (e.g., dotnet, js, php, python, ruby, java, scala, go) to calculate libyear metrics.

- Etymology: The term "libyear" combines "lib" (short for library) and "year," reflecting the common form of software dependency.

- Additional Metrics: Tools also provide other measurements related to versioning and releases, helping developers prioritize maintenance.

- Community Contribution: Encouragement for contributions to enhance the libyear ecosystem and tools.

## Content (from Notion)

A simple measure of software dependency freshness. It is a single number telling you how up-to-date your dependencies are.

## Example

## Simpler is Better

There are more nuanced ways to calculate dependency freshness. This approach is simple. You can explain this calculation in 30s.

## Before

Better cartoon welcome :)

## After

## Example 2

If your system has a one year old dependency and a three year old dependency, then your whole system is four libyears old.

## A Healthy App

At Singlebrook we try to keep our client’s apps below 10 libyears. We regularly rescue projects that are over 100 libyears behind.

## Etymology

"lib" is short for "library", the most common form of dependency.

## Other Measurements

libyear-bundler implements some of the other metrics described by (Bouwers, Eekelen, Visser, 2015).

The --versions flag provides a metric for an installed dependency’s freshness relative to the newest release’s major, minor, and patch versions. Of course, this is most useful for dependencies that follow a consistent versioning scheme such as semver.

The --releases flag provides a metric for the number of releases between an installed version of dependency and the newest released version of the dependency.

Each metric has it’s own advantages and disadvantages, and all quantify the maintenance burden for an app. Taken together, they can help prioritize maintenance for an inherited app, or help maintain a baseline level of dependency freshness for an ongoing project.
