Hey,

I feel like we haven’t talked in months. I don’t quite have my G-File sea legs yet, so be prepared for some zigs and zags as I veer one way or another like Pete Hegseth racing into the Fox & Friends studio the morning after a bachelor party.

We might as well start with the Hunter Biden pardon, but—beyond saying “it’s bad”—I’ll try not to repeat what many have already said.

Jonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C. Prior to that, enormous lizards roamed the Earth. More immediately prior to that, Jonah spent two decades at National Review, where he was a senior editor, among other things. He is also a bestselling author, longtime columnist for the Los Angeles Times, commentator for CNN, and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. When he is not writing the G-File or hosting The Remnant podcast, he finds real joy in family time, attending to his dogs and cat, and blaming Steve Hayes for various things.
