Grug Notes is a product from Kamanu Composites. Yes, we make canoes. We design them, build them from scratch, and sell them directly to customers. We do everything in-house to a fault — including building our own software since 2008. In 2020, we made 900,000 face shields and stayed organized with Roam Research. We learned a lot about scale, note-taking, and life.

After that, we knew what we wanted: the organization without the overhead. The linking without the learning curve. Notes that work when you're on the shop floor. So, in October 2022, we put a text box on a website, and Grug Notes was born. We march forward, always keeping simplicity at our core and our roots in manufacturing in our hearts.

Use Grug free for 30 days—no credit card, no hoops.
