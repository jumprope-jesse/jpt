If a computer is a bicycle for the mind, then Monarch is its ergonomic handlebars—it's a tool to navigate and control your computer with less effort and more efficiency.

### Powerful calculator

Do standard math, calculate the time between dates, compare timezones, convert units & currencies, and more. Create variables to calculate even faster. You can even calculate annoying monthly subscription costs!

### System Controls

Easily access deeper macOS settings like Display, Touch ID, Wallpaper, and Keyboard. Use Commands to hide unfocused apps, lock screen, control the volume and microphone, sleep, and more — all with 1-second interactions.

### Unlimited Clipboard history

Searchable clipboard history. Filter by app or content type. Rename your favorite or frequently used items.

### Browser Bookmarks

Monarch gives you immediate access to your browser bookmarks with control over how and where each bookmark is opened by holding the ⌘ key.

## Monarch Notes

Write notes anywhere, anytime with markdown with ⌘ + dot even while in fullscreen. Monarch Notes work seamlessly with apps like Obsidian and more with no artificial restrictions or limitations. All notes are saved locally on your Mac.

## Clipboard History

There's so much less information you'll have to remember once you have clipboard history. If you think you might need something later, just copy it. If it's important, rename it with ⌘ R. Beautiful visuals and blazingly fast search make it effortless to recall things by link, content, application, or even the text in screenshots.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does Monarch do and what is it for?

Monarch works like a superpowered Spotlight Search, enabling you to do many more things on your computer within a single interface that is simple, yet powerful.

By extending the functionality and user experience of Spotlight, you will be able to accomplish a lot of small, but important tasks throughout your day without breaking your flow, switching apps, or switching workspaces.

### What are the benefits to using Monarch?

There are many benefits to using Monarch, but for brevity, I'll name the first few that come to mind:

1) Everything is easier. While Monarch does quite literally speed up your workflow, what users truly care about is that whatever Monarch is capable of, it is the easiest way to get it done. Monarch is not a command palette app. It's designed to change the UI to best suit the task at hand, and you see this in things like controlling audio devices with the Set Audio Devices command or the Color Picker mode.

2) You'll get work done faster. Open Monarch with ⌥ Space (or your own shortcut), and you're instantly able to access a calculator, currency converter, app launcher, notes, color picker, clipboard history and emoji picker and more — all in one interface, each in their own intuitive ways.

3) Cost. Monarch is capable of replacing several different apps for the cost of one app, with a one-time payment. If you find that you only like one aspect of Monarch, there are settings that allow you to use Monarch for only that function.

4) Less things to remember. Monarch is meticulously designed to do two things: reduce cognitive overhead and reduce context switching. Major features (called Modes) can be cycled using the Tab key, and other tools are accessed in the most simple and intuitive ways: To use the calculator start typing "100 + 200", or "5 days from now". To use the emoji picker, search emojis by starting with a colon (example :fire to get 🔥). To define a word, type "define (a word)", for example "define monarch". Most of the functionality works in ways you're already used to. Now it's in a single interface, accessible with a single hotkey, without context switching.

### I want to work faster, but Monarch looks overwhelming. How do I get started?

The list of features can make Monarch appear much more intimidating than it is. Fortunately, you can use as little or as much functionality as you need at any given moment without even being aware of the rest of the app!

If you don't know where to get started, the best way is to simply download Monarch and start using it as a way to open apps and as a calculator. Whenever you're done working or taking a break, use the "sleep" or "lock screen" command. The rest will come naturally.

### What is the Luna license (version 0.x)?

The Luna license is a special license that gives you free upgrades forever.

Typically with sofware licenses, you pay one-time to own that specific version and in order to upgrade to the next major version (for example 1.0 to 2.0), you would pay to upgrade your license. For users that own a Luna license, they will be able to upgrade from version 0.x to version 2.0 to 3.0 and so on, forever, at no additional cost. It's my way of thanking those that supported early.

Once Monarch 1.0 is released, there will be no more Luna licenses available for purchase, so they are very limited!

### How do I manage my licenses to swap devices?

You will soon be able to create and log into a Monarch account and manage your devices on the platform. In the meantime, I can unlink your dlicense keys remotely just as easily if you reach out to me via email or the Discord server.

### Does Monarch offer student discounts?

Yes. Reach out to me at rmdashrfv@hey.com from the email address provided by your school to get a student discount

### What exactly is a Superlink?

A Superlink is a powerful way to have instant access to your favorite apps or websites while making it easy to utilize different values or optional values every time.

For example: I have a Superlink set up to search my own projects on Github by typing "git" into Monarch, or another user's profile if I type their username, or navigate to my own profile if I specify neither. If the resulting URL is already open in my browser, Monarch will simply switch to that tab rather than opening a new one, keeping my workspace nice and organized.

Superlinks alone provide enough value to speed up your workflow significantly, and it's very much worth seeing what you can do with them by reading the manual entry here.

### Refund Policy

To keep revenue as predictable as possible without a subscription there are no refunds. Instead there is a 30 day free trial with absolutely no restrictions on the app. This is easier for everyone because there is absolutely zero pressure to purchase the app right away. Try it and see if you like it or see its potential. Don't buy it until you are convinced of one or both.

### Does Monarch track any data or my usage of the app?

Monarch is privacy conscious by design and does not track or transmit any of your data. There is no telemetry and it requires no login to use. Monarch does not even have automatic bug or crash reporting to minimize the opportunity for mishandling user data, which can sometimes be derived from bug context. The only external request made is to validate your license.

### What is the best way to report an issue?

The best way to report issues is via the bugs channel in the Discord server.

### What is the best way to request a feature?

The best way to request a feature is to post it to the Feature Request board. Feature requests posted here are given priority based on votes by other users. It's best to post a feature request as soon as you have the idea because updates are shipped very quickly and the sooner I know what you need, the easier it is to plan to build.
