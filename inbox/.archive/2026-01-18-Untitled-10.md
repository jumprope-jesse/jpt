## AI Summary (from Notion)
- The author has a complicated relationship with complex systems science, feeling both intrigued and frustrated by its lack of straightforward explanations.
- There is skepticism about the field, which often sounds vague or "woo-like," especially concepts like the "edge of chaos."
- The primary textbook on complex systems fails to provide clear definitions or exciting insights, describing them as any dynamical system.
- The textbook emphasizes various fields related to complex systems, including:
- Economics
- Sociology
- Biology
- Evolution
- Neuroscience
- AI
- Probability theory
- Ecology
- Physics
- Chemistry
- A key takeaway from a podcast with David Krakauer, president of the Santa Fe Institute, is that "complex systems" refers to "complex adaptive systems," highlighting their adaptive nature.
- The author notes that all these fields contribute different mathematical and data perspectives on the fundamental question of how "thinking" particles would interact.
- The fields can be categorized into foundational (physics, probability theory, chemistry) and high-level (economics, sociology, evolution, AI), all connected under the umbrella of complex systems.
- The text suggests a growing interest in understanding the interdisciplinary nature of complex systems and their relevance to various scientific inquiries.

## Content (from Notion)

I have a long and confused love-hate relationship with the field of complex systems. People there never want to give me a simple, straightforward explanation about what its about, and much of what they say sounds a lot like woo ("edge of chaos" anyone?). But it also seems to promise a lot! This from the primary textbook on the subject:

> 

Of course, that textbook never actually described what the mosaic it thought it saw actually was. The closest it came to was:

> 

Which... well... isn't very exciting, and as far as I can tell just describes any dynamical system (co-evolving or no).

The textbook also seems pretty obsessed with a few seemingly random fields:

- Economics
- Sociology
- Biology
- Evolution
- Neuroscience
- AI
- Probability theory
- Ecology
- Physics
- Chemistry
"What?" I had asked, and I started thinking

> 

And each time I heard a complex systems theorist talk about why their field was important they would say stuff like

> 

That is, until I found this podcast with David Krakauer[1].

Now, to be clear, his framing of complex systems science is... lets say... controversial. But he is the president of the Santa Fe Institute, so not just some crackpot[2]. Anyway, he says that the phrase "complex systems" is a shortening of the more accurate phrase "complex adaptive systems". That is, complex systems are adaptive systems which are complex.

Ok, what does complex mean? I'll leave it to David to explain

> 

Remind you of anything?

Now we can go back to our list:

- Economics
- Sociology
- Biology
- Evolution
- Neuroscience
- AI
- Probability theory
- Ecology
- Physics
- Chemistry
And its pretty clear how this ties together. Each field provides new math and data on the same underlying question: How would particles interact if they could "think"? Some of the above provides more foundational stuff (physics, probability theory, chemistry--in particular the study of equilibria and bottlenecks), and others provide more high-level stuff (economics, sociology, evolution, AI), but its all clearly related under this banner.
