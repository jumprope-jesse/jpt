# Flowcode · Build visual AI flows that integrate with your codebase

## Overview (from Notion)
- Efficiency in Work: This tool can help streamline your development processes, allowing you to focus more on family and less on debugging complex code.

- Empower Your Team: By utilizing a low-code platform, you can enable team members without extensive coding skills to contribute, fostering collaboration and innovation.

- Flexibility and Control: The open-source nature of the platform means you can customize workflows to suit your specific business needs without vendor lock-in, which is crucial for a founder.

- Work-Life Balance: Automating repetitive tasks can free up time for personal pursuits or family activities, enhancing overall quality of life.

- Stay Ahead of Trends: Engaging with cutting-edge AI tools can position your company as a leader in technology, attracting top talent and clients.

- Unique Perspective: Consider how AI can not only solve current problems but also shape the future of your business, potentially opening new markets or opportunities.

- Alternate View: While low-code platforms offer speed, some might argue they lack the depth and customization that traditional coding provides, which could be a concern for complex projects.

This flow is triggered via the SDK by a new user signup and generates insights on every new user

The Problem

## Code is messy and complex. No-code is too basic

Building production-grade AI workflows requires constant iterations. Code is hard to follow and debug, and requires constant developer access. Existing visual tools aren’t good enough for production.

The Solution

## Build production-grade visual workflows with an AI copilot

Get the speed and simplicity of low code with code-level flexibility and control. Build fast, debug visually and deploy with one click.

Flyde: The Secret Sauce

## No vendor lock-in. Self-host your flows

Flowcode is the only low-code platform based on an open-source visual programming language.

That means you can export your flows without converting them to code or hosting a huge docker. Just paste the flow into a  file using our  VS Code extension and you’re good to go.
