# I'm on a Committee
  (Phong Ngo)

  Oh, give me a pity, I'm on a committee
  Which means that from morning to night
  We attend and amend and contend and defend
  Without a conclusion in sight.

  We confer and concur, we defer and demur
  And re-iterate all of our thoughts
  We revise the agenda with frequent addenda
  And consider a load of reports.

  We compose and propose, we suppose and oppose
  And the points of procedure are fun!
  But though various notions are brought up as motion
  There's terribly little gets done.

  We resolve and absolve, but never dissolve
  Since it's out of the question for us.
  What a shattering pity to end our committee
  Where else could we make such a fuss?
