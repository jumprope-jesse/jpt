# The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

## Overview (from Notion)
- Mastering Tools: Emphasizes the importance of becoming proficient with command-line tools and version control, which can streamline your workflow.
- Practical Skills: Offers insights into practical skills that are often overlooked in formal education, enhancing your effectiveness as a software engineer and founder.
- Career Efficiency: Learning these tools can significantly reduce the time spent on mundane tasks, allowing for more focus on strategic decisions and innovation.
- Community Resources: The course is accessible beyond MIT, opening avenues for networking and learning from others in the tech community.
- Diverse Perspectives: Encourages collaboration and sharing knowledge across languages and cultures through translated resources, fostering a global tech community.
- Alternate Views: Some might argue that focusing on tools detracts from core programming skills; however, proficiency with these tools can enhance overall programming prowess.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Classes often overlook essential skills like tool proficiency, which this course aims to address by teaching command-line mastery, text editor use, version control, and more. The schedule includes topics such as shell tools, debugging, and security, with resources available online, including translations in multiple languages. The course is co-taught by Anish, Jon, and Jose, and aims to benefit a wider audience beyond MIT.

## Content (from Notion)

Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!

Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem impossibly complex.
