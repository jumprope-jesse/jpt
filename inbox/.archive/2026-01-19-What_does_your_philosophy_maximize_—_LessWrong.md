# What does your philosophy maximize? — LessWrong

## Overview (from Notion)
- Philosophical Schools: Reflect on how your values align with different philosophies (theism, atheism, empiricism) and how they influence your decisions as a parent and leader.
- Maximization Algorithms: Consider what you prioritize most—predictive power in software development, internal peace in family life, or freedom of thought in your entrepreneurial ventures.
- Conflict and Understanding: Recognize that differing viewpoints among colleagues or family members can stem from their own value maximization; fostering understanding can lead to more fruitful discussions.
- Balance: Strive for a balance between rationality in your work and emotional intelligence in family life; both are crucial for success and happiness.
- Growth Mindset: Embrace the idea that philosophies can evolve—what you value now may change as you face new challenges in personal and professional realms.
- Diverse Perspectives: Remain open to alternative viewpoints, such as holistic or community-centered approaches, which may offer insights into parenting and leadership that differ from your current philosophy.
- Life Satisfaction: Reflect on whether the metrics you prioritize (success, happiness, stability) truly lead to fulfillment, and be willing to adjust your focus as necessary.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Philosophical schools like theism, atheism, and empiricism serve as maximization algorithms for different desires. People often view others as misguided based on differing metrics they prioritize, leading to disdain. Instead of trying to convert others, consider whether they benefit from their current beliefs, as no single philosophy is universally superior.

The universe is vast and complex, and we like to take mental refuge from this vastness by following some philosophical school. These philosophical schools come in many different shapes and sizes, and while listing them all is quite impractical, there are three that I often hear in discussions nowadays: theism, atheism, and empiricism (or rationalism).

These discussion are more often heated than not. The reason being that when you subscribe to any of these philosophies, it becomes all too easy to come up with many reasons to justify why someone taking refuge under any other school of thought is fundamentally misguided:

- Theists see non-believers as fundamentally lacking the love of (the) God(s), or as unfortunate souls doomed to destruction.
- Atheists see believers as sheep following old scriptures written by some megalomaniacs seeking control over the masses.
- Empiricists see others as idiots too blinded by their ideals to actually see reality as it is.
It is quite likely that, if you are reading this on LessWrong, you are an empiricist, an atheist, or both. Have you ever wondered why you chose these schools of thought over the others? Or why it is it that you get such mixed feelings when thinking about people following ideas you don't believe in?

I see philosophical schools as maximization algorithms. You subscribe to a philosophy when its algorithm maximizes what you desire most. Some choose empiricism because they want to maximize predictive power. Some choose theism because they want to maximize mental integrity. Some choose atheism because they want to maximize freedom of thought.

The reason you see others outside your school of thought as misguided fools is because they are maximizing an entirely different metric to the one you are, perhaps unwittingly, maximizing yourself. When the metric they are maximizing at least correlates positively to yours, you can tolerate them. When the metric they are maximizing is negatively correlated to yours, you feel disdain, and perhaps even a desire to correct their lack of 'common sense'.

I've held these feeling all too many times. I've spent way too much energy foolishly trying to 'right' the world. But now I've chosen a different approach: before trying to convert someone to my school of thought, first I ask myself: does this person necessarily want to maximize what I am maximizing? Or would they be better off maximizing whatever they are doing right now?

There is no universal rule saying that predictive power is any more useful than internal peace, or vice-versa. There is no real reason to convince your friend to be a rationalist if they are already living a happy life.
