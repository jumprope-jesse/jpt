MinutesLink not only transcribes and summarizes every client call, but it also records and stores all the information in one place. This makes it easy to review, comment, and analyze. If there's ever a disagreement later about who said what, I can always refer back and provide proof. This backup is very useful, and I’m glad to have it.
