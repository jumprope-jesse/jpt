This is a linkpost for https://affablyevil.substack.com/p/lets-design-a-school-part-23

In the previous post, we outlined three phases that students would go through, where each student matriculated through them at their own speed.

Phase 1 was literacy and numeracy.

Phase 2 was core civilizational requirements and survey courses.

Phase 3 was core adulting requirements and self-study.

There are two specific curricula involved in these phases: core civilizational requirements and core adulting requirements.

In this post, we’ll go into more detail about the core civilizational requirements.

# Core Civilizational Requirements

What does it mean to live in this day and age?

Where does the material abundance we take for granted come from?

What was life actually like for most of human history, and why is it so much better now?

These are questions that everyone ought to be able to answer, and the fact that most students - and most people, I suspect - can’t is an indictment of our educational system.

The context in which we live and the forces that shape it are core to our understanding of our place in history and the systems, tools, and structures that got us here.

This curriculum draws heavily from the field of progress studies.

We mentioned six classes in the previous post: basic economics, basic statistics, basic industrial history, basic civics/governance, basic scientific method, and basic information (previously media) literacy. We don’t expect this list to be exhaustive, but it’s a good starting point.

## Basic Economics

### Motivation

I am far from an expert on economics, but I can tell you what supply and demand are, and why they matter. I can talk about the elasticity of supply and demand, and how that generally determines where the burden of a tax falls. I can tell you what price floors and ceilings do to markets.

I can tell you why markets work, and why it matters.

This should not be some kind of elite knowledge. It shouldn’t be hidden behind a college course. It is literally the framework within which our entire economy functions.

This should be taught to every child in every school.

The curriculum will center around this diagram:

There are already plenty of basic economics courses, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to adapt these courses to a level suitable to those in phase 2 (around 10-13). Keep in mind that students are not matriculated by age as well - if they need to be older to grasp these concepts, that’s fine. There’s no need for a whole lot of math - in fact, aside from understanding the graph above, very little math should be needed at all.

### In Order To Pass

To pass the course, students will need to take an in-person exam demonstrating understanding of:

- Supply, Demand, and the Price Equilibrium
- Why the supply and demand curves slope the way they do
- What elasticity of supply and demand mean
- The effects of price floors and ceilings
- Where the burden of a tax falls, and the effects of a tax
- Why markets beat central planning
- Where markets fail
## Basic Statistics

### Motivation

An understanding of probability and risk is crucial, not just to hedge fund managers and poker players, but to everyone in their everyday life. And lack of this understanding underlies some of the most basic logical fallacies and biases in human cognition.

If you check the weather one morning to see that there’s a 50% chance of rain, what does that mean? If you get tested for cancer with a test that has a 2% false positive rate, what are the odds you actually have cancer? What’s the expected value of a lottery ticket, a 401k, or a mortgage?

These question matter for the big decisions in life - everything from your health to what college you decide to go to. Thinking about the future means thinking about probability, which today’s education severely under-equips students to do.

A firm grounding in basic probability and statistics will enable students to make informed decisions about their money, their health, and their future, while equipping them to understand the basics of how data is presented and what it means.

### In Order To Pass

To pass the course, students will need to take an in-person exam demonstrating understanding of:

- A Frequentist and Bayesian interpretation of probability
- Compound growth, both of investments and of debt
- An understanding of mean, median, and mode
- An understanding of distributions (normal, power)
- An understanding of “and” vs “or” and “not” in probability
- How to do an expected value calculation
- An understanding of how statistics and probability matters in their life, specifically
## Basic Industrial History

### Motivation

History is a difficult subject to teach, much less design a curriculum for.

Not only are there thousands of years of material to cover, from all over the globe, there’s a multitude of perspectives and lenses to apply to every one of those years.

The task of designing a curriculum is made easier by the fact that we’re designing a mandatory curriculum - that is, a class that everyone is compelled to take and pass. We can therefore restrict ourselves to the history that we feel everyone needs to know.

An American student, in this day and age, doesn’t need to know about the Aztec empires or the Ming dynasty. They don’t even need to know about the American revolution or the Civil War - when would such knowledge affect them in their daily lives?

What those students do need to know, on the other hand, is how the modern era is different from the rest of human history, and why. They need to understand where the abundance they’ve been born in comes from, and what pillars support our society and way of life.

Failure to understand these topics leads voters and citizens to make poor choices when it comes to taxation, regulation, and governance. It leads to a stark misunderstanding of how wealth is created and distributed, which underscores some of the most heinous regimes ever created in human history.

### In Order To Pass

To pass the course, students will need to take an in-person exam demonstrating understanding of:

- Core ideas of the industrial revolution, including energy available per capita, precise measurements, and interchangeable parts
- Human life before and after the industrial revolution, in terms of life expectancy, child and mother mortality, etc.
- How capitalism and the corporation, along with private property and governmental protection of rights, enable positive-sum interactions between people
- How humanity has solved dire problems in the past, including the polio vaccine, the green revolution, the Haber-Bosch process, the hole in the ozone layer, acid rain, and so on
- An understanding of the exponential nature of progress, from the industrial revolution to Moore’s Law
- An overview of great human works, from the Panama Canal and the interstate highway system to the Hoover Dam and the space program
## Basic Civics/Governance

### Motivation

If you’re an American citizen, you get a single vote, same as everyone else. What you choose to do with that vote, on its own, rarely matters - but what everyone does with their votes matters a great deal.

I think a large amount of unrest and unhappiness with the results of our government - not all of it, nor even a majority, but a large portion nonetheless - comes from not understanding how it works. It’s a lot easier to view an elected president as illegitimate when you don’t get how they got elected in the first place.

### In Order To Pass

To pass the course, students will need to take an in-person exam demonstrating understanding of:

- The three branches of our government, and the division of power between them
- The idea of Federalism and the division of power between federal, state, and local governments
- How important officials get their jobs
- A history of political parties, the role they play, and both the good and bad they do
- The functioning of the legal system in civil and criminal cases
- The rights of each citizen
## Basic Scientific Method

### Motivation

The word ‘science’ is used to refer to both: a) a methodology for reaching the truth and b) the knowledge accumulated using that methodology.

Understanding what this methodology is, why it’s different from what came before it, and how to use it in every aspect of one’s life is crucial to understanding how humanity has accomplished what it has.

### In Order To Pass

To pass the course, students will need to take an in-person exam demonstrating understanding of:

- The core of science: Ideas are tested by experiment. Alternatively put: the most effective way to gain true knowledge about the world is to interact with the world.
- How experiments behave differently based on what’s true about the world
- The scientific process as it currently stands
- A probabilistic understanding of evidence, and the difference between evidence and proof
- How making predictions is a better way to test one’s knowledge than trying to explain the past
- Correlation and causality
## Basic Information Literacy

### Motivation

The information environment people find themselves in today is completely alien to the one evolution prepared us for. It’s completely alien to what people had for almost all of history. It’s almost completely alien to what people had twenty years ago!

Navigating this environment is a key skill, not just to navigate the world in general, but to learning itself. What information can be trusted? What are facts, and what is opinion?

It’s also crucial to prepare children for social media. As much as I would prefer it, I think a doctrine of abstinence from social media would be about as effective as the old-fashioned doctrine of abstinence.

### In Order To Pass

To pass the course, students will need to take an in-person exam demonstrating understanding of:

- Facts vs. Opinions
- How the map is not the territory
- How the media is about entertainment, not truth
- How social media distorts the truth
- How to research a topic
- How to change their own minds
# Conclusion

The above should not be considered a complete list - six bullet points do not equal a curriculum - but should convey the general ideas students are to learn about each topic, along with a vague sense of the level of understanding expected at the students’ ages when they take these courses.

To stress a point made in the introduction, the goal of phase 2 is to give students an understanding of the context of the world in which they live - how it functions materially, economically, and politically, and why it functions that way.

Too much of current american education is framed academically - subjects ascended in a particular order, history taught chronologically, etc. This makes sense for someone studying the subjects to attain mastery over them, but mastery is not a reasonable (or even desirable) goal for most students. Instead, phase 2 of this curriculum is geared towards giving students reasonable models for how the world works today. This gives them a way to place themselves and their choices in the context of the modern world.

If they want to further their studies in any of these areas, they are welcome to, but we only require a basic level of understanding.
