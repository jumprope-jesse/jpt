## Content (from Notion)

Amazon CodeCatalyst now supports the use of source code repositories hosted in Bitbucket Cloud in CodeCatalyst projects. This allows customers to use Bitbucket Cloud repositories with CodeCatalyst’s features such as its cloud IDE (Development Environments), Generative AI features such as Q feature development, and custom blueprints. Customers can also trigger CodeCatalyst workflows based on events in Bitbucket Cloud, view the status of CodeCatalyst workflows back in Bitbucket Cloud , and even block Bitbucket Cloud pull request merges based on the status of CodeCatalyst workflows.

Customers want the flexibility to use source code repositories hosted in Bitbucket Cloud, without the need to migrate to CodeCatalyst to use its functionality. Migration is a long process and customers want to evaluate CodeCatalyst and its capabilities using their own code repositories before they decide to migrate. Support for popular source code providers such as Bitbucket Cloud is the top customer ask for CodeCatalyst. Now customers can use the capabilities of CodeCatalyst without the need for migration of source code from Bitbucket Cloud.

This capability is available in regions where CodeCatalyst is available. There is no change to pricing.
