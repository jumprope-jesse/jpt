## About

Chrono Divide is a fan-made project which aims to recreate the original "Red Alert 2" from the "Command & Conquer" series using web technologies. The result is a game client that runs in your web browser, with no additional plugins or applications installed.

The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser. Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla "Red Alert 2" engine.

The game client now supports fully working multiplayer, all original maps and more.
