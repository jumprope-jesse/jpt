Coherence X5 is the most powerful way to transform websites into true Mac apps.

Instead of running in a cluttered browser window, your favorite sites become standalone, lightweight apps — isolated for focus and security, yet powered by Chrome’s speed and flexibility. Each app can be customized with its own extensions, profiles, and settings, so it works exactly the way you need it to. Whether it’s email, productivity tools, or streaming services, Coherence makes the web feel like it belongs on macOS.

Building a Coherence app is effortless — and smarter than ever.

Just enter a URL, pick an icon, and give it a name. In seconds, your site becomes a polished, standalone app ready for your Mac.

Whether you want a clean, single-window experience, a full browser with tabs, or complete privacy, Coherence X5 adapts to how you work.

# The simplest way to turn a website into a true Mac app. Standard apps open in a single, distraction-free window that feels like it was designed for macOS — no extra toolbars, no clutter, just focus.

# Need the flexibility of a browser with the isolation and customization of a standalone app? Tabbed apps bring multiple pages together with full tab support — perfect for grouping related tools like Gmail, Calendar, and Drive into a single workspace.

Why settle for just Chrome? Coherence X5 supports the most popular Chromium-based browsers, giving you the same speed and compatibility, plus the ability to pick the experience that best matches your workflow or privacy needs.

At the heart of every Coherence app is a powerful browser extension that turns custom Chrome apps into something that feels unmistakably Mac. From intelligent window behavior to deep link handling and seamless session recall, it’s what makes a Coherence app more than just a browser in disguise.

# With Link Forwarding, you control which links open inside your Coherence app — and which should forward to your default browser. No more breaking out of context or juggling popups.

# Click your app’s icon in the Dock, and it just works — reopen a minimized window or launch a fresh one with the correct content. Coherence apps behave like real Mac apps, not web shortcuts with odd quirks.

Coherence X5 is packed with thoughtful tools to help you build, manage, and customize your apps with ease. From icon design to full app library control, everything's designed to give you power without complexity.

From designers to developers to everyday Mac users, people are switching to Coherence for a reason. Here’s what they’re saying.

# Does exactly what it says it will do for Chrome apps, and make sure you pair it with their Safari version called Unite. I have been using them for a year to isolate specific web apps like Gmail, Google Voice, ChatGPT, and a lot of my self-hosted applications (Plex, TrueNAS, Proxmox, etc.)

# Useful for those platforms that are only accessed through a web browser, the possibility of simulating a native application of the system, greatly improves the visualization as well as its use.

# Makes working with web-apps like Office 365, Miro, Gmail, and others much easier by making them appear as their own apps, so I can ⌘+Tab between them. Unlike the “native” offerings (which are often just kiosk mode browsers) you can install extensions and ad blockers etc. Highly recommended.

# It works pretty well. It lets me put my work Gmail in a dedicated app so I can used my ⌘+tab muscle memory when switching between it and other apps It also lets me be logged into my personal gmail in Safari, keeping it separte from my work account. It also works with my USB Yubikey for multi-factor login, which is critical.
