Amazon Q Developer now offers enhanced cost management capabilities, enabling customers to analyze costs across a wider range of Cloud Financial Management domains with more advanced analytical capabilities. Customers can now ask complex, open-ended questions about historical and forecasted costs and usage, optimization recommendations, commitment coverage and utilization, cost anomalies, budgets, free tier usage, product attributes, and cost estimation. Q can explore data, form hypotheses, and perform calculations to provide deeper insights with less time and expertise required.

With these capabilities, FinOps practitioners, engineers, and Finance professionals can increase productivity by delegating more cost analysis and estimation tasks to Q. For example, customers can ask "Why did costs for this application increase last week?". Q will explore the data by retrieving costs and usage quantities by service, account, or resource, form hypotheses, gather data from multiple sources, and perform calculations ranging from simple period-over-period cost changes to unit economic metrics like effective cost per instance-hour. Q provides transparency on each API call it makes to retrieve data, including specific parameters used, and provides matching console links where customers can verify the data or dive deeper.

To get started, open the Amazon Q chat panel from anywhere in the AWS Management Console and ask a question about your costs. To learn more, see Managing your costs using generative AI with Amazon Q Developer in the AWS Cost Management user guide.
