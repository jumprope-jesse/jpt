Today, AWS announced the release of a model context protocol (MCP) server for Billing and Cost Management, now available in the AWS Labs GitHub repository. The Billing and Cost Management MCP server allows customers to analyze their historical spending, find cost optimization opportunities, and estimate the costs of new workloads using the AI agent or assistant of their choice.

Artificial intelligence is transforming the way that customers manage FinOps practices. While customers can access AI-powered cost analysis and optimization capabilities in Amazon Q Developer in the console, the Billing and Cost Management MCP server brings these capabilities to any MCP-compatible AI assistant or agent that customers may be using, such as Q Developer CLI tool, the Kiro IDE, Visual Studio Code, or Claude Desktop. This MCP server gives these clients rich capabilities to analyze historical and forecasted cost and usage data, identify cost optimization opportunities, understand AWS service pricing, find cost anomalies, and more. The MCP server not only provides access to AWS service APIs; it also provides a dedicated SQL-based calculation engine allowing AI assistants to perform reliable, reproducible calculations — ranging from period-over-period changes to unit cost metrics — and easily handle large volumes of cost and usage data.

You can download and integrate the open-source server with your preferred MCP-compatible AI assistant. The server connects securely to the AWS Billing and Cost Management services using standard AWS credentials with minimal configuration required. To get started, visit the AWS Labs GitHub repository.
