### What is this and what does it do?

This is a tool that takes any link and makes it look malicious. It works on the idea of a redirect. Much like https://tinyurl.com/ for example. Where tinyurl makes an url shorter, this site makes it look malicious.

Place any link in the below input, press the button and get back a fishy(phishy, heh...get, it?) looking link. The fishy link doesn't actually do anything, it will just redirect you to the original link you provided.
