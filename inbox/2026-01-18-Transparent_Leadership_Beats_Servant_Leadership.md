# Transparent Leadership Beats Servant Leadership

## Overview (from Notion)
- Leadership Style: Reflect on how transparent leadership can improve your management approach, fostering independence in your team while also teaching them essential problem-solving skills.
- Parenting Parallel: Consider the similarities between parenting and leadership—coaching and teaching your children to navigate life’s challenges independently can mirror your role as a leader.
- Skill Development: Emphasize the importance of continuous learning, both for yourself and your team, ensuring you remain technically relevant and respected.
- Networking: Leverage your connections in NYC to facilitate growth and opportunity for your team, creating a culture of collaboration and support.
- Bureaucracy vs. Innovation: Challenge the norm of creating unnecessary bureaucracy; instead, focus on innovation and problem-solving, keeping the work dynamic and engaging.
- Unique Value: Your background as a software engineer and founder gives you a unique perspective on integrating technology into leadership—use this to enhance communication and efficiency in your team.
- Alternate Views: Some may argue that servant leadership is vital for empathy and support; however, consider whether it truly prepares your team for autonomy and resilience in the long run.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
Effective leadership resembles parenting, where transparent leadership is preferred over servant leadership. A good leader coaches, connects, and teaches problem-solving while fostering independence and career growth in their team. Instead of becoming a bottleneck, leaders should focus on making themselves redundant and returning to technical challenges, thus maintaining respect and relevance within the organization.

tl:dr: Parenting and leadership is similar. Teach a man to fish, etc.

I spent a couple of years managing a team, and I entered that role – like many – without knowing anything about how to do it. I tried to figure out how to be a good manager, and doing so I ended up reading a lot about servant leadership. It never quite sat right with me, though. Servant leadership seems to me a lot like curling parenting: the leader/parent anticipate problems and sweep the way for their direct reports/children.

To be clear, this probably feels very good (initially, anyway) for the direct reports/children. But the servant leader/curling parent quickly becomes an overworked single point of failure, and once they leave there is nobody else who knows how to handle the obstacles the leader moved out of the way for everyone. In the worst cases, they leave behind a group of people who have been completely isolated from the rest of the organisation, and has no idea what their purpose is and how to fit in with the rest of the world.

I would like to invent my own buzzword: transparent leadership. In my book, a good leader

- coaches people,
- connects people,
- teaches people methodical problem solving,
- explains values and principles embraced by the organisation to aid them in making aligned decisions on their own,
- creates direct links between supply and demand (instead of deliberately making themselves a middle man),
- allows their direct reports career growth by gradually taking over leadership responsibilities,
- continuously trains their replacement, and
- generally makes themselves redundant.
The middle manager that doesn’t perform any useful work is a fun stereotype, but I also think it’s a good target to aim for. The difference lies in what to do once one has rendered oneself redundant. A common response is to invent new work, ask for status reports, and add bureaucracy.

A better response is to go back to working on technical problems. This keeps the manager’s skills fresh and gets them more respect from their reports. The manager should turn into a high-powered spare worker, rather than a paper-shuffler.
