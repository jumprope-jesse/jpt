## Overview (from Notion)
- Claudius offers a multi-session interface that allows you to manage multiple AI chat windows, which can enhance productivity when juggling family and work responsibilities.
- The app's version control feature can help streamline collaborative projects, making it easier to manage software development tasks while balancing parenting duties.
- The integration of AI-powered tools aims to simplify complex coding tasks, potentially freeing up time for family activities.
- The focus on democratizing AI in software development presents a unique opportunity to engage with the latest technologies and potentially inspire your children about coding and innovation.
- Consider the balance between tech and personal life; while Claudius is a fun side project, it emphasizes the importance of not letting work interfere with family time.
- Alternate view: Embracing AI tools can lead to over-reliance on technology, which may detract from hands-on parenting and personal interactions.

Claudius is designed with the goal of democratizing AI-powered building.

Warning: it's not even close to there yet, but that's what I'm working towards.

Claudius' long term mission is a massive task, and it's currently just a fun side project for me (my day job is at Sentry). I'm not sure how long it will take to get to a stable release, but I'm working on it.
