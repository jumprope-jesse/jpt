Remember everything.

Organize nothing.

iPhone Mockup

In a time when every company has a bid on our data, when we exchange our privacy for information, when every move we make is influenced by how others will perceive it, we have little space to call our own.

Our minds have been taken captive –

by social approval systems, by newsfeeds and timelines, by advertisements and corporate agendas. Our information is scattered across platforms, bound by terms and conditions.

What should have never been lost is now yours again. We promise:

The first and only extension

for your real mind.

One place for everything you care about.

No need to file it, label or even tag it. It’s all

magically organized and visualized for you.

Just save it. Artificial

IntelligenceAtakes

care of the rest.

Save anything with a click and stay in the flow.

mymind understands what it is and remembers

the important details, so you don't have to.

Folders are dead. This is your personal search engine.

Search by color, keyword, brand, date – whatever

you think of first. Associative search & visual cues work

with your brain to find it instantly.

A treasure trove of ideas,

inspiration & references

Ideas no longer slip away. Take quick notes on the go and enter Focus Mode to expand on them later. Clean and simple.

No URL is treated the same. Your new mind knows if

an item is an article, a product, a book or even a recipe.

Every link is saved in a beautiful way that makes sense.

Save entire articles to your mind to read without

clutter, ads or annoying pop-ups. mymind strips

out the excess so you can focus.

All your notes, bookmarks, inspiration, articles
and images in one single, private place.
Always with you, synced across devices.

Search any keyword you remember from a meme, handwritten notes or photo containing text, and mymind can read the image and find it for you.
