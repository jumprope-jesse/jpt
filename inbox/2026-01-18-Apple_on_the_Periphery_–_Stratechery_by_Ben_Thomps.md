# Apple on the Periphery – Stratechery by Ben Thompson

## Overview (from Notion)
- The discussion around Apple's diminishing impact reflects ongoing shifts in tech, suggesting you stay adaptable and open to innovation—important in your role as a founder.
- SpaceX's spectrum acquisition hints at the future of broadband, which could affect remote work and connectivity, critical for a software engineer.
- The geopolitical insights from China's military display might inform your understanding of global markets and partnerships, especially relevant in tech sectors.
- The emphasis on AI in browsers and productivity tools could inspire you to explore integrations or features that enhance user experience in your own products.
- The contrast between Apple's legacy and emerging technologies challenges the notion of brand loyalty; consider how this might influence your own startup's positioning.
- Alternative views include the potential for traditional giants like Apple to pivot effectively, or for new entrants to disrupt established norms—stay vigilant for opportunities.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
This week's highlights include Ben Thompson's reflections on the lack of excitement surrounding the latest iPhone launch, contrasting Apple's focus on traditional products with the industry's shift towards AI. Additionally, SpaceX's $17 billion acquisition of spectrum aims to enhance Starlink's broadband capabilities, while discussions around China's recent military parade explore its geopolitical implications.

Additionally, you have complete control over what we send to you. If you don’t want to receive This Week in Stratechery emails (there is no podcast), please uncheck the box in your delivery settings.

On that note, here were a few of our favorites this week.

1. If an Apple falls in the forest... Now that I’ve moved back to America, I watched the iPhone event live for the first time in a long time — and I seemed to be the only one! I exaggerate slightly, but not entirely: iPhone launches used to capture the attention of the entire industry, but this week not many people seemed to care, and those that did were unimpressed. I had the opposite reaction: I think the new iPhones are really good, and big jump forward; the reason people are disappointed is because, as the industry focuses on AI, Apple’s willing abdication of entire product categories speaks much larger than their continued excellence in past paradigms. — Ben Thompson
1. Why Is SpaceX Buying Spectrum? SpaceX is paying $17 billion for the rights to use EchoStar spectrum, in a move to improve its ability to deliver Starlink broadband to cell phones in remote areas, beyond the reach of cell towers. Tuesday’s Daily Update examines the logic of that news, including a helpful explainer of the different bands of spectrum required to serve Starlink customers, and why SpaceX will still rely on partnerships as it pushes further into the direct-to-cell market. As for the broader direction? The spectrum deal comes as SpaceX peers are floundering and facing delays on new satellite deployments. This week’s move appears to be a bet that SpaceX can offer service that’s so superior that companies like Apple, Verizon, and AT&T will have no choice but to partner with Starlink going forward, positioning SpaceX to be the only entity making money on satellite cellphone service. — Andrew Sharp
1. Five Questions After China’s Victory Day Parade. One week after China hosted Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un for a military parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War, Bill Bishop and I discussed the scene in Beijing and what it signals for geopolitics in 2025. Though the pageantry did not necessarily signal any shift that would be new to anyone who’s been paying attention, the images of China partnering with authoritarian states while displaying next generation military hardware and unprecedented nuclear capabilities seemed to strike a chord with international audiences. Come for questions about the EU’s response (or lack thereof) and a Russian natural gas partnership that may reshape global energy markets, and stay for discussion of China’s relationship to North Korea and a hot mic moment in which Xi and Putin mull immortality. — AS
- Atlassian Buys The Browser Company, Browser Wars, Why Atlassian — Atlassian bought The Browser Company, seeking to deliver an AI-enabled browser for work. It’s a reasonable bet, but I’m skeptical that browsers are the future.
- SpaceX Buys Spectrum, Spectrum Specifics, SpaceX’s Big Bet — SpaceX just made a huge deal for spectrum, but they will still need partners; the real goal is knocking competition out of the game.
- iPhones 17 and the Sugar Water Trap — Apple’s iPhone announcement was impressive, but no one was impressed, because Apple is increasingly peripheral to what is changing the world.
- An Interview with Dan Kim About Intel, Nvidia, and the U.S. Government — An interview with Dan Kim about the CHIPS program, why the U.S. took a stake in Intel, and the fraught dispute about Nvidia and China.
