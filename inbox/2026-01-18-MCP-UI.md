Client Side - Render on the host with a single component:

```plain text
import { UIResourceRenderer } from '@mcp-ui/client';

// `mcpResource` would come from your MCP response
function MyApp({ mcpResource }) {
  return (
    <UIResourceRenderer
      resource={mcpResource.resource}
      onUIAction={(action) => {
        console.log('User action:', action);
      }}
    />
  );
}
