# pnpm 10.16 | pnpm

## Overview (from Notion)
- The introduction of the minimumReleaseAge setting can enhance security in your development environment, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities from newly released dependencies.
- The advanced dependency filtering with finder functions allows for more precise management of project dependencies, which is crucial for maintaining clean code in a fast-evolving tech landscape.
- This feature can help you quickly identify and manage packages that are essential for your projects, such as ensuring compatibility with specific versions of React, potentially saving time in debugging and development.
- Emphasizing the use of eco-friendly materials and sustainable practices in your projects can resonate well with clients and users in NYC, where sustainability is increasingly valued.
- These improvements aim to simplify your workflow, allowing you more time to focus on innovation and leadership within your company.
- An alternate viewpoint might question the complexity added by new settings and functions; however, the trade-off for increased security and efficiency may be worth it, especially in a competitive environment.

## AI Summary (from Notion)
New features in pnpm 10.16 include a setting for delayed dependency updates to mitigate risks from compromised packages, and advanced dependency filtering using finder functions to search by properties beyond just name. Patch changes address various issues, including deprecation warnings and process cancellation behavior.

## Minor Changes

### New setting for delayed dependency updates

There have been several incidents recently where popular packages were successfully attacked. To reduce the risk of installing a compromised version, we are introducing a new setting that delays the installation of newly released dependencies. In most cases, such attacks are discovered quickly and the malicious versions are removed from the registry within an hour.

The new setting is called minimumReleaseAge. It specifies the number of minutes that must pass after a version is published before pnpm will install it. For example, setting minimumReleaseAge: 1440 ensures that only packages released at least one day ago can be installed.

If you set minimumReleaseAge but need to disable this restriction for certain dependencies, you can list them under the minimumReleaseAgeExclude setting. For instance, with the following configuration pnpm will always install the latest version of webpack, regardless of its release time:

```plain text
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
- webpack

```

Related issue: #9921.

### Advanced dependency filtering with finder functions

Added support for finders.

In the past, pnpm list and pnpm why could only search for dependencies by name (and optionally version). For example:

```plain text
pnpm why minimist

```

prints the chain of dependencies to any installed instance of minimist:

```plain text
verdaccio 5.20.1
├─┬ handlebars 4.7.7
│ └── minimist 1.2.8
└─┬ mv 2.1.1
└─┬ mkdirp 0.5.6
  └── minimist 1.2.8

```

What if we want to search by other properties of a dependency, not just its name? For instance, find all packages that have react@17 in their peer dependencies?

This is now possible with "finder functions". Finder functions can be declared in .pnpmfile.cjs and invoked with the --find-by=<function name> flag when running pnpm list or pnpm why.

Let's say we want to find any dependencies that have React 17 in peer dependencies. We can add this finder to our .pnpmfile.cjs:

```plain text
module.exports = {
finders: {
react17: (ctx) => {
return ctx.readManifest().peerDependencies?.react === "^17.0.0";
},
},
};

```

Now we can use this finder function by running:

```plain text
pnpm why --find-by=react17

```

pnpm will find all dependencies that have this React in peer dependencies and print their exact locations in the dependency graph.

```plain text
@apollo/client 4.0.4
├── @graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0
└── graphql-tag 2.12.6

```

It is also possible to print out some additional information in the output by returning a string from the finder. For example, with the following finder:

```plain text
module.exports = {
finders: {
react17: (ctx) => {
const manifest = ctx.readManifest();
if (manifest.peerDependencies?.react === "^17.0.0") {
return `license: ${manifest.license}`;
}
return false;
},
},
};

```

Every matched package will also print out the license from its package.json:

```plain text
@apollo/client 4.0.4
├── @graphql-typed-document-node/core 3.2.0
│   license: MIT
└── graphql-tag 2.12.6
  license: MIT

```
