# Conductor

## Overview (from Notion)
- Conductor allows you to run multiple Claude Codes in parallel, which can enhance productivity and efficiency in your software development projects.
- It provides an isolated workspace for each Claude, making it easier to identify who is working on what and troubleshoot any issues.
- The ability to see real-time updates and changes can help in managing projects effectively, especially in a fast-paced environment like NYC.
- Using Conductor could streamline your workflow, allowing you to focus on building and innovating rather than getting bogged down by technical hurdles.
- The integration with Claude Code means you can leverage your existing tools without needing to adapt to a completely new system.
- Consider the potential for collaboration with your team—real-time visibility into code progress can foster a more dynamic work environment.
- Alternative views might include concerns about relying too heavily on a single tool for workflow management or the learning curve associated with implementing new software.
