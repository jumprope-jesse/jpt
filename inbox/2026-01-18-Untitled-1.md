## Overview (from Notion)
- Async combines AI coding with task management, streamlining your workflow as a software engineer, making it easier to manage both coding and family time.
- The tool is designed to handle tedious tasks, freeing you up for more critical projects—perfect for balancing work with fatherhood.
- Its emphasis on structured thinking can help you enhance your problem-solving skills, valuable in both coding and parenting challenges.
- The open-source nature of Async aligns with community-driven values, fostering collaboration among engineers, which can be inspiring for a founder.
- Unique perspective: Async encourages critical thinking, contrasting with many tools that prioritize convenience, which could lead to deeper insights in your work.
- Alternative view: Some might argue that relying on AI tools could lead to dependency, potentially stifling creativity or individual problem-solving skills.

## FAQ

### 1. What is Async?

Async is an open-source dev tool that combines AI coding with task management and code review. It's like Claude Code + Linear + GitHub PRs in one opinionated tool.

### 2. What can Async do?

Busywork: bug fixes, UI tweaks, and simple features. Coding agents can't do everything and we think it's a mistake to ask them to do more than they can. Async focuses on the tedious, leaving you free to build what's important.

### 3. Who is Async for?

Engineers. We built Async for ourselves: we're two engineers who've been working in tech for almost a decade now. We care about code, often overly so, and wanted to build a tool that would meet our own standards.

### 4. How is Async different than other coding agents?

We say no. We ask questions in response to ambiguous asks. Async is designed to make the user think; we encourage structured and critical thinking over lazy interfaces that optimize for convenience.

### 5. How does Async work?

Each task in Async is just a GitHub issue. For each task, we run a research agent to confirm requirements and ask clarifying questions. Then we execute tasks in a separate container in the cloud and open a GitHub PR automatically with the changes.

### 6. How much is Async?

We offer a hosted version with a free tier of 10 tasks a day and paid tier of $20 / month.
