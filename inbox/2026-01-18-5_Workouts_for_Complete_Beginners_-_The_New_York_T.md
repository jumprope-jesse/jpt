The new year is a perfect time to start an exercise habit, but it can be overwhelming to figure out where to begin.

Jenny Liebl, a trainer at the International Sports Sciences Association, recommends new exercisers start by making a list of reasons they want to exercise, focusing on how they want to feel — for example, less tired in the morning, more limber or more energetic.

As you try different workouts, track how you’re feeling over time, Ms. Liebl said. “After you do a week or two of this, how is your sleep? How is your knee and back feeling?”

This approach allows you to use yourself as your benchmark, she said, instead of comparing yourself to other people. Many beginners are too hard on themselves, Ms. Liebl added, and assume they aren’t doing enough, which makes it hard to keep going.

It doesn’t matter how often you exercise at first, she said, as long as you can find a routine. Pick a time on your calendar to exercise — say, once a week — and be consistent.

“No matter what you do, if you do it consistently, that’s where you see results,” Ms. Liebl said.

But you don’t have to find the perfect workout on Day 1. Use your first month to explore a few different kinds of movement and see what you like and what feels good. You might surprise yourself.

With this in mind, here are five workouts for complete beginners to help you get moving in the year ahead.

## The non-workout workout

For some people, simply calling something a workout can be a mental block. So just start with a simple set of movements in the morning to get ready for the day. You don’t even have to leave your bedroom.

How long: 10 minutes

What it’s good for: Beginning to move and developing a habit

How often: Once per week to start

## A workout to help you move easier

Mobility, a blend of flexibility and strength, is important for everyday movements like bending down or reaching a high shelf. Improving it takes less time than you might think, if you are deliberate. The key is to find movements that build strength throughout your full range of motion.

How long: 10 minutes

What it’s good for: Feeling more comfortable and stable as you move

How often: Up to three times per week

## Intro to Pilates

Pilates is not just another workout fad; it’s a great way to build strength for daily life. Many studio classes are built around an apparatus called a reformer that uses springs and bands to create resistance. But you can also do an effective version of the workout at home — without any equipment.

How long: 10 minutes

What it’s good for: Building core strength, improving posture and strengthening the mind-body connection

How often: Once per week to start

## Yoga to wind down

Yoga is another excellent way to build a fitness habit. It can help you relax, improve your flexibility and help you feel more comfortable after a long day of sitting. A gentle session in the evening can also be a useful tool to prepare for sleep after a long day.

How long: 10 minutes

What it’s good for: Calming your mind and loosening up your body

How often: Up to three times per week

## A workout for better balance

Balance, like strength and flexibility, is important to maintain as you get older. It’s a good idea to test yourself every now and then to see how steady you feel on your feet. If you’re not happy with the results, these exercises can help you improve.

How long: Less than 10 minutes

What it’s good for: Improving your sense of balance and equilibrium

How often: Up to two or three times per week
