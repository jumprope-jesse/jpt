# i'm just having fun

## Overview (from Notion)
- Embrace the idea that coding and technology should be fun and exploratory rather than competitive; this can help alleviate some stress associated with the tech field.
- Consider the value of playfulness in programming—experimenting with code can lead to innovative solutions and a more enjoyable experience.
- Reflect on the importance of diverse specialties; not everyone must excel in the same areas, and expertise in non-tech fields can be equally respected.
- Understand that learning comes from both effort and curiosity—it's okay to not know everything; focus on what interests you.
- Explore the notion that art and creativity can be integrated into coding, making technology not just a tool but a form of expression.
- Recognize the significance of building tools for yourself—these can enhance productivity and bring satisfaction, especially amid the challenges of being a founder.
- Keep in mind the recommendation to engage with the tech community, sharing experiences and learning from others can enrich your journey.
- Consider the societal mystique surrounding STEM fields; challenge the notion that intelligence is solely defined by technical ability.

IT IS ONLY COMPUTER  Reilly Wood

i work professionally on a compiler and write about build systems in my free time and as a result people often say things to me like "reading your posts points to me how really smart you are" or "reading a lot of this shit makes me feel super small". this makes me quite uncomfortable and is not the reaction i'm seeking when i write blog posts.

## it's not a competition

i mean, in some sense if you work as a professional programmer it is a competition, because the job market sucks right now. but i think usually when people say they feel dumb, it's not in the sense of "how am i supposed to get a job when jyn exists" but more "jyn can do things i can't and that makes me feel bad".

### you can do hard things

all the things i know i learned by experimenting with them, or by reading books or posts or man pages or really obscure error messages. sometimes there's a trick to it but sometimes it's just hard work. i am not magic. you can learn these things too.

### everyone has their own area of specialization

if you don't want to spend a bunch of time learning about how computers work, you don't have to! not knowing about gory computer internals does not make you dumb or computer illiterate or anything. everyone has their own specialty and mine is compilers and build systems. i don't know jack shit about economics or medicine! having a different specialty than me doesn't mean you're dumb.

i really hate that computing and STEM have this mystique in our society. to the extent that engineering demonstrates intelligence, it's by repeatedly forcing you to confront the results of your own mistakes, in such a way that errors can't be ignored. there are lots of ways to do that which don't involve programming or college-level math! performance art and carpentry and running your own business or household all force you to confront your own mistakes in this way and deserve no less respect than STEM.

## if i can't feminize my compiler, what's the point?

by and large, when i learn new things about computers, it's because i'm fucking around. the fucking around is the point. if all the writing helps people learn and come up with cool new ideas, that's neat too.

half the time the fucking around is just to make people say "jyn NO". half the time it's because i want to make art with my code. i really, sincerely, believe that art is one of the most important uses for a computer.

i'm not doing this for the money. i happened to get very lucky that my passion pays very well, but i got into this industry before realizing how much programmers actually make, and now that i work for a european company i don't make US tech salaries anyway. i do it for the love of the game.

some extracts from the jyn computer experience:

screenshot of a rust-lang PR titled 'use bold magenta instead of bold white for highlighting'. the first sentence in the description is 'according to a poll of gay people in my phone, purple is the most popular color to use for highlighting'

a series of quotes such as "jyn yeah you're fucking insane" and "what the actual fuck. but also i love it"

screenshot of a bluesky post by jyn that says "She is humming. She is dancing. She is beautiful." below are three pictures, one J program, and a quote-tweet of A Ladder To by Jana H-S.

screenshot of a discord conversation. it reads: jyn: for a while i had a custom build of rustc whose version string said “love you love you love you” in purple. jyn: i should bring that back now that i work on ferrocene. anon: You've heard of cargo mommy now get ready for rustc tsundere

screenshot of a shell command showing the version of a custom-built rustc. it says "Ferrocene rolling love you love you love you", with the "love you"s in purple.

you really shouldn't take advice from me lol

however! if you are determined to do so anyway, what i can do is point you towards:

highest thing i can recommend is building a tool for yourself. maybe it's a spreadsheet that saves you an hour of work a week. maybe it's a little website you play around with. maybe it's something in RPGmaker. the exact thing doesn't matter, the important part is that it's fun and you have something real at the end of it, which motivates you to keep going even when the computer is breaking in three ways you didn't even know were possible.

second thing i can recommend is looking at things other people have built. you won't understand all of it and that's ok. pick a part of it that looks interesting and do a deep dive on how it works.

i can recommend the following places to look when you're getting started:
