## Notes & Context
- Impatient about $500-1K/month AWS savings that's being delayed
- May have incorrect assumptions about offshore contractor costs (~$50K vs actual ~$100K)
- Open to Jesse's proposal: take one of two budgeted positions + half the other salary for AI budget
- Doesn't want Jesse working alone in engineering
- Background is non-technical - impressed by idea of automating repetitive tasks
