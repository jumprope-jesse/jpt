## Philosophy & Principles

**On Speed**: Moving quickly increases learning frequency and forces prioritization. "A week is 2% of the year."

**On Teams**: Smaller teams are superior—faster decisions, fewer meetings, higher quality work. "Large-scale engineering projects are more soluble in IQ than they appear."

**On Progress**: "It is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences" through knowledge and technology. Focus on raising ceilings rather than floors.

**On Knowledge**: The efficient market hypothesis is inaccurate. "We know less than we think." The replication crisis reflects broader epistemological challenges.

**On Motivation**: Prioritizes deriving satisfaction from improving ideas over external validation.
