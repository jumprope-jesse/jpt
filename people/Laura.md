## Meeting History
- 2025-12-16: Review Q1 Product Goals - Team rejected OE 2.0 terminology and navigation hierarchy; wants "enrollment process" instead of "managed forms"; requesting longer, enrollment-specific terms vs generic language

## Notes & Context
- Her team provides critical stakeholder feedback for product development
- Has specific opinions about user-facing terminology that differ from product team's broader use case vision

- **Position secure** following Jason/Jennifer departures - considered the most competent VP at Aeries
- Holds significant institutional knowledge that makes her indispensable
